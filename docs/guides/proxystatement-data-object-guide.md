## Executive Compensation (XBRL - High Reliability)

Executive compensation data is extracted from XBRL using the SEC's Executive Compensation Disclosure (ECD) taxonomy. This data is highly standardized and available for all companies.

### PEO (Principal Executive Officer / CEO)

| Property | Type | XBRL Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `peo_name` | `str` | `ecd:PeoName` | CEO name | `"Mr. Cook"` |
| `peo_total_comp` | `Decimal` | `ecd:PeoTotalCompAmt` | Total compensation from Summary Compensation Table | `74,609,802` |
| `peo_actually_paid_comp` | `Decimal` | `ecd:PeoActuallyPaidCompAmt` | Compensation Actually Paid (CAP) | `168,980,568` |

### Non-PEO Named Executive Officers (NEOs)

| Property | Type | XBRL Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `neo_avg_total_comp` | `Decimal` | `ecd:NonPeoNeoAvgTotalCompAmt` | Average NEO total compensation | `27,178,896` |
| `neo_avg_actually_paid_comp` | `Decimal` | `ecd:NonPeoNeoAvgCompActuallyPaidAmt` | Average NEO compensation actually paid | `58,633,525` |

### Compensation Time Series (5 Years)

The `executive_compensation` property returns a DataFrame with 5 years of compensation data:

```python
proxy = filing.obj()
comp_df = proxy.executive_compensation  # pd.DataFrame
```

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `fiscal_year_end` | `date` | End of fiscal year |
| `peo_total_comp` | `Decimal` | PEO total from SCT |
| `peo_actually_paid_comp` | `Decimal` | PEO compensation actually paid |
| `neo_avg_total_comp` | `Decimal` | Non-PEO NEO average total |
| `neo_avg_actually_paid_comp` | `Decimal` | Non-PEO NEO average CAP |

### Example Output

```python
# Apple Inc. Executive Compensation (5 years)
fiscal_year_end  peo_total_comp  peo_actually_paid_comp  neo_avg_total_comp  neo_avg_actually_paid
2024-09-28       74,609,802      168,980,568             27,178,896          58,633,525
2023-09-30       63,209,845      106,643,588             26,938,240          48,892,163

2021-09-25       98,734,394      311,845,801             26,989,456          89,764,231
2020-09-26       14,769,259       4,567,123              23,976,158          12,589,743
```

### Named Executives (Dimensional Data)

Some companies tag individual executive data using dimensional XBRL. When available:

```python
# Check if individual executive data is available
if proxy.has_individual_executive_data:
    executives = proxy.named_executives  # list of executive dicts
    for exec in executives:
        print(f"{exec['name']}: ${exec['actually_paid_comp']:,}")
```

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `has_individual_executive_data` | `bool` | Whether individual executive dimensions are available |
| `named_executives` | `list[dict]` | Individual executive compensation details (when available) |

**Note**: Only ~60% of companies use dimensional tagging (AAPL, JPM, JNJ). Others aggregate to PEO vs Non-PEO NEO averages (MSFT, XOM).

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Extract Executive Compensation

```python
from edgar import Company

# Get company and filing
company = Company("AAPL")
filing = company.get_filings(form="DEF 14A").latest()

# Get proxy statement object
proxy = filing.obj()

# Access executive compensation
print(f"CEO: {proxy.peo_name}")
print(f"CEO Total Compensation: ${proxy.peo_total_comp:,}")
print(f"CEO Compensation Actually Paid: ${proxy.peo_actually_paid_comp:,}")
print(f"NEO Average Compensation: ${proxy.neo_avg_actually_paid_comp:,}")
```

### Example 2: Pay vs Performance Analysis

```python
from edgar import Company

company = Company("MSFT")
filing = company.get_filings(form="DEF 14A").latest()
proxy = filing.obj()

# Get pay vs performance DataFrame
pvp = proxy.pay_vs_performance

# Calculate pay-for-performance correlation
correlation = pvp['peo_actually_paid_comp'].corr(pvp['total_shareholder_return'])
print(f"CEO Pay vs TSR Correlation: {correlation:.2f}")

# Compare to peer group
print(f"Company TSR: {proxy.total_shareholder_return}%")
print(f"Peer Group TSR: {proxy.peer_group_tsr}%")

## HTML-Based Data (Future Features)

The following data is available in DEF 14A HTML sections but requires parsing. These are documented for future implementation.

### Beneficial Ownership

| Section | Reliability | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Principal Shareholders | Medium | Shareholders owning >5% of shares |
| Director/Executive Ownership | Medium | Shares owned by insiders |

**Extraction Pattern**: Search for "beneficial ownership" or "security ownership" section headers, then extract embedded tables.

### Board of Directors

| Data | Reliability | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Director Names | Medium | Full list of board members |
| Director Ages | Medium | Ages of directors |
| Director Tenure | Medium | Years on board |
| Independence Status | Medium | Independent vs non-independent |
| Committee Memberships | Medium | Audit, Compensation, Governance |

**Extraction Pattern**: Search for "board of directors" or "director nominees" sections, parse structured narrative and tables.

### Director Compensation

| Data | Reliability | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Director Fees | Medium | Annual retainer and meeting fees |
| Stock Awards | Medium | Equity compensation |
| Total Compensation | Medium | Sum of all compensation |

**Extraction Pattern**: Look for "director compensation" section, extract compensation table.

### Voting Proposals

| Proposal Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Election of Directors | Board member elections |
| Ratification of Auditors | Audit firm approval |
| Say-on-Pay | Executive compensation advisory vote |
| Shareholder Proposals | Proposals submitted by shareholders |
| Equity Plan Amendments | Stock compensation plan changes |

**Extraction Pattern**: Search for "PROPOSAL" headers, extract proposal number, title, and board recommendation.

### Audit Information

| Data | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Auditor Name | Independent auditor firm |
| Audit Fees | Fees for audit services |
| Tax Fees | Fees for tax services |
| Other Fees | Other professional fees |

**Extraction Pattern**: Search for "audit" or "independent registered" sections, extract fee tables.

## Notes for Implementation

1. **XBRL Namespace**: The primary namespace for proxy data is `ecd:` (Executive Compensation Disclosure), introduced by SEC in 2022 for fiscal years ending on or after December 16, 2022.

2. **Dimensional Tagging Variation**:
   - ~60% of companies tag individual executive data using `dim_ecd_IndividualAxis`
   - ~40% only provide aggregate data (PEO and Non-PEO NEO averages)
   - Always check `has_individual_executive_data` before accessing individual executives

3. **Time Series Data**: Pay vs Performance tables include 5 years of historical data per SEC requirements. This enables robust trend analysis.

4. **Compensation Actually Paid (CAP)**: This SEC-mandated metric differs from Summary Compensation Table totals due to adjustments for:
   - Change in pension value
   - Stock/option awards fair value changes
   - Vesting date fair values

5. **Company-Selected Measure**: Each company chooses one performance measure they consider most important. Common choices include:
   - Revenue or Net Sales
   - Operating Income
   - Free Cash Flow
   - Adjusted EBITDA
   - Return on Invested Capital

6. **Peer Group**: Companies define their own peer groups for TSR comparison. The peer group composition is disclosed in the filing but not structured in XBRL.

7. **Amendment Handling**: DEF 14A/A filings contain corrections or updates. Always use the most recent filing for a given fiscal year.

8. **Form Variants**:
   - `DEF 14A`: Standard proxy statement
   - `DEFA14A`: Additional soliciting materials (may have limited data)
   - `DEFM14A`: Merger-related proxy (may have different structure)

9. **Fiscal Year Alignment**: Match compensation periods with company fiscal year ends, which vary by company (e.g., Apple uses September, Microsoft uses June).

10. **Large Cap Coverage**: XBRL data is highly reliable for S&P 500 companies. Smaller companies may have less complete tagging.
