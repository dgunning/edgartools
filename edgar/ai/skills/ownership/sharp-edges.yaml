# Sharp Edges - Production gotchas for Ownership (Form 4) Analysis

sharp_edges:
  - id: raw-dataframe-vs-summary
    summary: Use get_ownership_summary() not raw transaction DataFrames
    severity: high
    solution: |
      summary = form4.get_ownership_summary()
      print(f"Activity: {summary.primary_activity}")  # "Purchase", "Sale", "Mixed"
      print(f"Net shares: {summary.net_change:,}")    # positive=buy, negative=sell
      print(f"Net value: ${summary.net_value:,.0f}")
    detection_pattern: 'common_stock_sales\.iterrows|derivative_transactions\.iterrows'

  - id: transaction-code-confusion
    summary: Transaction codes have specific meanings (P=Buy, S=Sell, A=Grant, M=Exercise, F=Tax)
    severity: medium
    solution: |
      summary = form4.get_ownership_summary()
      # primary_activity interprets codes correctly:
      # - "Purchase" = actual open market buying (P)
      # - "Sale" = actual selling (S)
      # - "Grant/Award" = compensation (A), not a purchase
      # - "Exercise" = converting options (M), not buying
      # - "Tax" = shares sold for taxes (F)

  - id: shares-with-footnotes
    summary: Use shares_numeric to handle footnoted values
    severity: medium
    solution: |
      for trans in summary.transactions:
          shares = trans.shares_numeric    # Handles footnotes like "(1)"
          price = trans.price_numeric
          value = trans.value_numeric

  - id: remaining-shares-interpretation
    summary: remaining_shares is post-transaction ownership
    severity: low
    solution: |
      summary = form4.get_ownership_summary()
      traded = summary.net_change         # Transaction amount
      owned = summary.remaining_shares    # Total ownership after

  - id: form3-vs-form4
    summary: Form 3 is initial ownership, Form 4 is changes
    severity: low
    solution: |
      form3 = company.get_filings(form="3")[0].obj()   # Initial ownership
      form4 = company.get_filings(form="4")[0].obj()   # Changes
      form5 = company.get_filings(form="5")[0].obj()   # Annual summary
