    "\n",
    "Use **edgartools** to track beneficial ownership from SEC Schedule 13D and 13G filings -- completely free, no API key or paid subscription required. When an investor acquires more than 5% of a public company, they must file a Schedule 13D (activist) or 13G (passive) disclosing their ownership stake.\n",

    "- Find Schedule 13D and 13G filings for any company\n",
    "- Extract ownership stakes, voting power, and reporting persons\n",
    "- Read the \"purpose of transaction\" to understand activist intent\n",
    "- Distinguish activist investors (13D) from passive holders (13G)\n",
    "- Track who owns 5%+ of any public company"
