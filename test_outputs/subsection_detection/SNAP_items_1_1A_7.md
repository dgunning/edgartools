### Item 1. Business.



### Overview


Snap Inc. is a technology company. We believe the camera presents the greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. We contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together.

Our flagship product, Snapchat, is a visual messaging application that enhances your relationships with friends, family, and the world. Visual messaging is a fast, fun way to communicate with friends and family using augmented reality, video, voice, messaging, and creative tools. Snaps are deleted by default to mimic real-life conversations, so there is less pressure to look popular or perfect when creating and sending images on Snapchat. By reducing the friction typically associated with creating and sharing content, Snapchat has become one of the most used cameras in the world.

The camera is a powerful tool for communication and the entry point for augmented reality experiences. By opening directly to the camera, Snapchat empowers our community to express themselves instantly and offers millions of augmented reality Lenses for self expression, learning, and play. In the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones. This is because images created by smartphone cameras contain more context and richer information than other forms of input like text entered on a keyboard. Given the magnitude of this opportunity, we are investing and innovating to continue to deliver products and services that are differentiated and that are better able to reflect and improve our life experiences.


### Snapchat


Snapchat is our core mobile device application and contains five distinct tabs, complemented by additional tools that function outside of the application. With a breadth of visual messaging and content experiences available within the application, Snapchatters can interact with any or all of the five tabs.

Camera: The Camera is a powerful tool for communication and the entry point for augmented reality experiences in Snapchat. Snapchat opens directly to the Camera, making it easy to create a Snap and send it to friends. Our augmented reality, or AR, capabilities within our Camera allow for creativity and self-expression. We offer millions of Lenses, created by both us and our community, along with creative tools and licensed music and audio clips, which make it easy for people to personalize and contextualize their Snaps. We also offer voice and scanning technology within our Camera. While Snaps are deleted by default to mimic real-life conversations, Snapchatters can save their creativity through a searchable collection of Memories stored on both their Snapchat account and their mobile device.

Visual Messaging: Visual Messaging is a fast, fun way to communicate with friends and family using AR, video, voice, messaging, and creative tools. We also offer My AI, our AI-powered chatbot, which helps our community foster creativity and connection with friends, receive real-world recommendations, and learn more about their interests and favorite subjects. They can also communicate through our proprietary personalized avatar tool, Bitmoji, and its associated contextual stickers and images, which integrate seamlessly into both mobile devices and desktop browsers.

Snap Map: Snap Map is a live and highly personalized map that allows Snapchatters to connect with friends and explore what is going on in their local area. Snap Map makes it easy to locate nearby friends who choose to share their location, view a heatmap of recent Snaps posted to Our Story by location, and locate local businesses. Places, rich profiles of local businesses that include information such as store hours and reviews, overlay specialized experiences from select partners on top of Snap Map, and allow Snapchatters to take direct actions from Snap Map, such as sharing a favorite store, ordering takeout, or making a reservation.

Stories: Stories are a fun way to stay connected, and feature content from friends, our community, and our content partners. Friends Stories allow Snapchatters to express themselves in narrative form through photos and videos, shown in chronological order, to their friends. The Discover section of this tab displays curated content based on a Snapchatter’s subscriptions and interests, and features news and entertainment from both our creator community and publisher partners. We also offer Public Profiles as a way for our creator community and our advertising partners to memorialize and scale their content and AR Lenses on our platform.

Spotlight: Spotlight showcases the best of Snapchat, helping people discover new creators and content in a personalized way. Here we surface the most entertaining Snaps from our community all in one place, which becomes tailored to each Snapchatter over time based on their preferences and favorites. The Trending page allows Snapchatters to discover and engage with popular topics and genres.

We are currently testing a new and simplified version of Snapchat referred to as Simple Snapchat, which organizes the tabs into three core experiences focused on communicating with friends, using the camera, and watching entertaining content.

In addition to our core Snapchat product, we offer Snapchat+, our subscription service that provides subscribers access to exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features. Snapchat+ offers a variety of features from allowing Snapchatters to customize the look and feel of their app to giving special insights into their friendships. We also offer Snapchat for Web, a browser-based product that brings Snapchat’s signature capabilities to the web.

Spectacles are our wearable AR glasses, which overlay computing over the world and extend the immersive AR Lenses experience beyond Snapchat. Spectacles are powered by Snap OS, a new purpose-built operating system with a natural interface that uses your hands and voice without the need for physical controllers. Spectacles are available to professional and hobbyist developers through our Spectacle Developer Program to create AR experiences through Lens Studio, our free AR development and distribution tool.


### Our Partner Ecosystem


Many elements and features of Snapchat are enhanced by our expansive partner ecosystem that includes developers, creators, publishers, and advertisers, among others. We help them create and bring diverse content and experiences into Snapchat, leverage Snapchat capabilities in their own applications and websites, and use advertising to promote these and other experiences to our large, engaged, and differentiated user base. We seek to reward our partner ecosystem for their creativity, and continue to support them as they grow their audience and build their business on Snapchat.

Developers are able to integrate with Snapchat and its core technologies, like Snap’s AR Camera and Bitmoji, through a variety of tools. Creative Kit gives developers and their communities a seamless sharing experience from their app directly to Snapchat. Through Camera Kit, our partners can embed Snap’s AR platform directly into their application, extending the use of AR beyond self-expression and communication use cases. We also provide developers a turnkey suite of tools and services that enable them to create AR Lenses and track the performance of those through analytics. Finally, developers can bring an inclusive mode of identity and expression to their apps and games with our Bitmoji for Developers APIs.

AR creators can use Lens Studio, our powerful desktop application designed for creators and developers, to build Lenses and AR experiences for Snapchatters. Spotlight creators can utilize our content creation tools to reach millions of Snapchatters and build their businesses through various monetization opportunities. Our Creator Marketplace connects both AR and Spotlight creators directly with our advertising partners. We provide monetizable opportunities through programs like the Snap Lens Network and Spectacles Lens Fund, which provide grants to support AR product development across many industries. We recognize and reward top performing Lenses through our Lens Creator Rewards program. We also support our content creator community through a number of programs, including advertising revenue sharing on our mid-roll advertisements in Snap Stars’ Stories and Spotlight.

Publisher partners can expand their audiences and monetize content through our Discover section. In addition, we work with various telecommunications providers and original equipment manufacturers, particularly as we build our presence in new markets.


### Our Advertising Products


We connect both brand and direct response advertisers to Snapchatters globally. Our ad products are built on the same foundation that makes our consumer products successful. This means that we can take the things we learn while creating our consumer products and apply them to building innovative and engaging advertising products familiar to our community.

AR Ads: Advertising through Snap’s AR tools unlocks the ability to reach a unique audience in a highly differentiated way through AR Lenses. AR Lenses are designed through our camera to take advantage of the reach and scale of our augmented reality platform to create visually engaging 3D experiences, including the ability to visualize and try on products such as beauty, apparel, accessories, and footwear. AR Lenses can be memorialized on Snapchat, through Public Profiles that aggregate content and lenses in a single, easy to find place.

Snap Ads: We let advertisers tell their stories the same way our users do, using full screen videos with sound. These also allow advertisers to integrate additional experiences and actions directly within these advertisements, including watching a long-form video, visiting a website, or installing an app. Snap Ads include the following:

•Single Image or Video Ads: These are full screen ads that are skippable, and can contain an attachment to enable Snapchatters to swipe up and take action.

•Story Ads: Story Ads are branded tiles that live within the Discover section of the Stories tab that can be either video ads or a series of 3 to 20 images.

•Collection Ads: Collection Ads feature four tappable tiles to showcase multiple products, giving Snapchatters a frictionless way to browse and buy.

•Dynamic Ads: Dynamic ads leverage our machine learning algorithm to match a product catalog to serve the right ad to the right Snapchatter at the right time.

•Commercials: Commercials are non-skippable for six seconds, but can last up to three minutes. These ads appear within Snapchat’s curated content.

•Sponsored Snaps: Sponsored Snaps allow advertisers to communicate visually with the Snapchat community through sponsored messages within the chat tab.

•Promoted Places: Promoted Places allow businesses to use the Snap Map to suggest sponsored places of interest to Snapchatters by highlighting the brand’s locations on the Snap Map with a promoted pin.

Campaign Management and Delivery: We aim to continually improve the way these ad formats are purchased and delivered. We have invested heavily to build our self-serve advertising platform, which provides automated, sophisticated, and scalable ad buying and campaign management.

We offer the ability to bid for advertisements that are designated to drive Snapchatters to: visit a website, make a purchase, visit a local business, call or text a business, watch a story or video, download an app, or return to an app, among others. Additionally, our delivery framework continues to optimize relevance of ads across the entire platform by determining the best ad to show to any given user based on their real-time and historical attributes and activity. This decreases the number of wasted impressions while improving the effectiveness of the ads that are shown to our community. This helps advertisers increase their return on investment by providing more refined targeting, the ability to test and learn with different creatives or campaign attributes in real time, and the dynamics of our self-serve pricing.

Measuring Advertising Effectiveness: We offer first-party measurement solutions and we support our advertising partners preferred third-party measurement solutions to provide a vast array of analytics on campaign attributes like reach, frequency, demographics, and viewability; changes in perceptions like brand favorability or purchase intent; and lifts in actual behavior like purchases, foot traffic, app installs, and online purchases.


### Technology


Our research and development efforts focus on product development, advertising technology, and large-scale infrastructure.

Product Development: We work relentlessly and invest deliberately to create and improve products for our community and our partners. We develop a wide range of products related to visual messaging and storytelling that are powered by a variety of new technologies.

Advertising Technology: We constantly develop and expand our advertising products and technology. In an effort to provide a strong and scalable return on investment to our advertisers, our advertising technology roadmap centers around improving our delivery framework, measurement capabilities, and self-serve tools.

Large-scale Infrastructure: We spend considerable resources and investment on the underlying architecture that powers our products, such as optimizing the delivery of billions of videos to hundreds of millions of people around the world every day. We currently partner with third party providers to support the infrastructure for our growing needs. These partnerships have allowed us to scale quickly without upfront physical infrastructure costs, allowing us to focus our efforts on product innovation.

Employees and Culture

We seek to be a force for good through our products, our work to strengthen our communities, our efforts to make a positive impact on the planet, and our inclusive workplace.

Supporting Our Team: Our values at Snap are being kind, smart, and creative, and we put those values into action through how we support our team and how our team supports one another. Council, which is a practice of active listening that promotes open-mindedness and cultivates empathy and compassion among participants, helps us build and sustain a community steeped in integrity, connection, collaboration, creativity, and kindness. Our talent development programs seek to unlock potential by helping team members advance, learn, and grow in a fair and equitable way at Snap. We focus on the health and well-being of our employees through programs and benefits that support their physical, emotional, and financial fitness. To attract and retain the best talent, we offer challenging work in an environment that enables our employees to have a direct meaningful contribution to new and exciting projects. Underlying these values is our commitment to ethical conduct where we work to instill in our team that acting with integrity means being your whole self, being honest, and doing the right thing.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Snap has long supported Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI, so that every team member uses their unique backgrounds, experiences, and abilities to build products that uplift the lived experiences of Snapchatters globally. To aid in our mission, we publish a Diversity Annual Report that discusses our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy. This report outlines our beliefs around the idea that an inclusive workplace and inclusive products are central to achieving that purpose. This report is excerpted in our broader CitizenSnap Report that details the work we’re doing to support our communities, our planet, and our team, and is available on our website at www.snap.com.

Human Capital: As part of our human capital resource objectives, we seek to recruit, retain, and incentivize our highly talented existing and future employees. We believe that creating an inclusive environment where team members can grow, develop, and be their true selves is critical to attracting and retaining talent. Our compensation philosophies also align to that belief.

Our compensation philosophy is based around building a culture of ownership and high performance by putting both impact and our values at the center of our performance feedback process and pay outcomes. We utilize equity as part of our compensation practices to drive a long-term orientation and have committed to paying a minimum living wage for all employees globally.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 4,911 full-time employees, of whom approximately 52% are in engineering roles involved in the design, development, support, and manufacture of new and existing products and processes.

Climate Change: Our commitment to combating climate change remains unchanged. In 2021, we adopted a set of science-based emissions reduction targets which were validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative. Additionally, in 2021, we achieved carbon neutrality with the purchase of carbon offsets for our historical operations from our founding in 2011 through 2020. Since then, we’ve maintained our carbon-neutral status each year through the purchase of carbon offsets for emissions attributable to us.


### Our Commitment to Privacy


Our approach to privacy is simple: Be upfront, offer choices, and never forget that our community comes first.

We built Snapchat as an antidote to the context-less communication that has plagued “social media.” Not so long ago, a conversation among friends would be just that: a private communication in which you knew exactly who you were talking to, what you were talking about, and whether what you were saying was being memorialized for eternity. Somewhere along the way, social media—by prioritizing virality and permanence—sapped conversations of this valuable context and choice. When we began to communicate online, we lost some of what made communication great: spontaneity, emotion, honesty—the full range of human expression that makes us human in the first place.

We don’t think digital communication has to be this way. That’s why choice matters. We build products and services that emphasize the context of a conversation—who, when, what, and where something is being said. If you don’t have the autonomy to shape the context of a conversation, the conversation will simply be shaped by the permanent feeds that homogenize online conversations.

When you read our Privacy Policy, we hope that you’ll notice how much we care about the integrity of personal communication. For starters, we’ve written our Privacy Policy in plain language because we think it’s important that everyone understands exactly how we handle their information. Otherwise, it’s hard to make informed choices about how you communicate. We’ve also created a robust Privacy, Safety, and Policy Hub where we show that context and choice are more than talking points. There, we point out the many ways that users can control who sees their Snaps and Stories, and explain how long content will remain on our servers, how users can manage the information that we do have about them, and much more. This is where you’ll also find our Transparency Report in which we provide insight into these efforts and visibility into the nature and volume of content reported on our platform.

We also understand that privacy policies—no matter how ambitious—are only as good as the people and practices behind those policies. When someone trusts us to transmit or store their information, we know we have a responsibility to protect that information and we work hard to keep it secure. New features go through an intense privacy-review process—we debate pros and cons, and we work hard to build products we’re proud of and that we’ll want to use. We handle user information with the same care that we want for our family, our friends, and ourselves.


### Competition


We compete with other companies in every aspect of our business, particularly with companies that focus on mobile engagement and advertising. Many of these companies, such as Alphabet (including Google and YouTube), Apple, ByteDance (including TikTok), Meta (including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp), Pinterest, and X (formerly Twitter), may have greater financial and human resources and, in some cases, larger user bases. Given the breadth of our product offerings, we also compete with companies that develop products or otherwise operate in the mobile, camera, communication, content, and advertising industries that offer, or will offer, products and services that may compete with Snapchat features or offerings. Our competitors span from internet technology companies and digital platforms, to traditional companies in print, radio, and television sectors to underlying technologies like default smartphone cameras and messaging. Additionally, our competition for engagement varies by region. For instance, we face competition from companies like Kakao, LINE, Naver (including Snow), and Tencent in Asia.

We compete to attract and retain our users’ attention, both in terms of reach and engagement. Since our products and those of our competitors are typically free, we compete based on our brand and the quality and nature of our product offerings rather than on price. As such, we invest heavily in constantly improving and expanding our product lines.

We also compete with other companies to attract and retain partners and advertisers, which depends primarily on our reach and ability to deliver a strong return on investment.

Finally, we compete to attract and retain highly talented individuals, including software engineers, designers, and product managers. In addition to providing competitive compensation packages, we compete for talent by fostering a culture of working hard to create great products and experiences and allowing our employees to have a direct meaningful contribution to new and exciting projects.


### Seasonality in Our Business


We have historically seen seasonality in our business. Overall advertising spend tends to be strongest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, and we have observed a similar pattern in our historical revenue. We have also experienced seasonality in our user engagement, generally seeing lower engagement during summer months and higher engagement in December.


### Intellectual Property


Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, internal procedures, and contractual provisions. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and

contractors and sign confidentiality agreements with third parties. Our internal controls are designed to restrict access to proprietary technology.

As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 4,169 issued patents and approximately 3,263 filed patent applications in the United States and foreign countries relating to our Snapchat, Lens Studio, Spectacles and Snap OS products, augmented reality, AI and machine learning, and other technologies. Our issued patents will expire between 2025 and 2047. We may not be able to obtain protection for our intellectual property, and our existing and future patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors.

We license content, trademarks, technology, and other intellectual property from our partners, and rely on our license agreements with those partners to use the intellectual property. We also enter into licensing agreements with third parties to receive rights to patents and other know-how. Third parties may assert claims related to intellectual property rights against our partners or us.

Other companies and “non-practicing entities” that own patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights related to the mobile, camera, communication, content, internet, and other technology-related industries frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property or other rights. As our business continues to grow and competition increases, we will likely face more claims related to intellectual property and litigation matters.


### Government Regulation


We are subject to many federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to advertising, algorithms, anti-money laundering, competition, consumer protection, content regulation, data protection, electronic funds transfers, employment, encryption, gift cards, health and safety, import and export restrictions, intellectual property, communication, money transmission, privacy, protection of minors, rights of publicity, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our business. Like other companies in our industry, we face increasingly heightened scrutiny from both the United States and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the consent order that we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, in December 2014, which resolved an investigation into some of our early practices. That order requires, among other things, that we establish a robust privacy program to govern how we treat user data. During the 20-year lifespan of the order, we must complete biennial independent privacy audits. The FTC has continued to review our practices and in January 2025, announced the referral of a complaint to the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, pertaining to our deployment of our My AI feature and the allegedly resulting risk of harm to young users. Any enforcement action related to this matter, or any violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. It is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all our products for an extended period of time or indefinitely. Due to such laws and regulations, our products may not be available in all locations. Our public policy team monitors legal and regulatory developments in the United States, as well as many foreign countries, and communicates with policymakers and regulators in the United States and internationally.

For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## SECTION: part_i_item_1a
Item 1A. Risk Factors.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. If any of the following risks actually occurs (or if any of those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occurs), our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be seriously harmed. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. Unless otherwise indicated, references to our business being seriously harmed in these risk factors will include harm to our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

Our ecosystem of users, advertisers, and partners depends on the engagement of our user base. Our user base growth rate has declined in the past and it may do so again in the future. If we fail to retain current users or add new users, or if our users engage less with Snapchat, our business would be seriously harmed.

We had 453 million daily active users, or DAUs, on average in the quarter ended December 31, 2024. We view DAUs as a critical measure of our user engagement, and adding, maintaining, and engaging DAUs have been and will continue to be necessary. Our DAUs and DAU growth rate have declined in the past and they may decline in the future due to various factors, including as the size of our active user base increases, as we achieve higher market penetration rates, as we face continued competition for our users and their time, or if there are performance issues with our service. In addition, as we achieve maximum market penetration rates among younger users in developed markets, future growth in DAUs will need to come from older users in those markets or from developing markets, which may not be possible or may be more difficult, expensive, or time-consuming for us to achieve. While we may experience periods when our DAUs increase due to products and services with short-term popularity, we may not always be able to attract new users, retain existing users, or maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement if current or potential new users do not perceive our products to be fun, engaging, or useful. In addition, because our products typically require high bandwidth data capabilities for users to benefit from all of the features and capabilities of our application, many of our users live in countries with high-end mobile device penetration and high bandwidth capacity cellular networks with large coverage areas. We therefore do not expect to experience rapid user growth or engagement in regions with either low smartphone penetration or a lack of well-established and high bandwidth capacity cellular networks. As our DAU growth rate continues to slow or if the number of DAUs becomes stagnant, or we have a decline in DAUs, our financial performance will increasingly depend on our ability to elevate user activity or increase the monetization of our users.

Snapchat is free and easy to join, the barrier to entry for new entrants in our business is low, and the switching costs to another platform are also low. Moreover, the majority of our users are 18-34 years old. This demographic may be less brand loyal and more likely to follow trends, including viral trends, than other demographics. These factors may lead users to switch to another product, which would negatively affect our user retention, growth, and engagement. Snapchat also may not be able to penetrate other demographics in a meaningful manner. Falling user retention, growth, or engagement could make Snapchat less attractive to advertisers and partners, which may seriously harm our business. In addition, we continue to compete with other companies to attract and retain our users’ attention. There are many factors that could negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:

•users engage more with competing products instead of ours;

•our competitors continue to mimic our products or improve on them;

•we fail to introduce new and exciting products and services or those we introduce or modify are poorly received;

•our products fail to operate effectively or compatibly on the iOS or Android mobile operating systems;

•we are unable to continue to develop products that work with a variety of mobile operating systems, networks, and smartphones;

•we do not provide a compelling user experience because of the decisions we make regarding the type and frequency of advertisements that we display or the structure and design of our products;

•we are unable to combat bad actors, spam, or other hostile or inappropriate usage on our products;

•there are changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products in the short-term, long-term, or both;

•there are concerns about the privacy implications, safety, or security of our products and our processing of personal data;

•our content partners do not create content that is engaging, useful, or relevant to users;

•our content partners decide not to renew agreements or devote the resources to create engaging content, or do not provide content exclusively to us;

•advertisers and partners display ads that are untrue, offensive, or otherwise fail to follow our guidelines;

•our products are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or approvals, including from foreign privacy regulators, or there are changes in our products that are mandated or prompted by legislation, regulatory authorities, executive actions, or litigation, including settlements or consent decrees, that adversely affect the user experience;

•technical or other problems frustrate the user experience or negatively impact users’ trust in our service, including by providers that host our platforms, particularly if those problems prevent us from delivering our product experience in a fast and reliable manner, or cyberattacks, breaches, or other security incidents that compromise our sensitive user data;

•we fail to provide adequate service to users, advertisers, or partners;

•we do not provide a compelling user experience to entice users to use the Snapchat application on a daily basis, or our users don’t have the ability to make new friends to maximize the user experience;

•we, our partners, or other companies in our industry segment are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity, some of which may be inaccurate or include confidential information that we are unable to correct or retract;

•we do not maintain our brand image or our reputation is damaged; or

•our current or future products reduce user activity on Snapchat by making it easier for our users to interact directly with our partners.

Any decrease to user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, advertisers, or partners, and would seriously harm our business.

We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of advertisers, or a reduction in how much they spend could seriously harm our business.

Substantially all of our revenue is generated from third parties advertising on Snapchat. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, advertising revenue accounted for approximately 91%, 96%, and 99% of our total revenue, respectively. Even though we have introduced other revenue streams, including subscription models, we still expect advertising revenue to account for substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future. Most advertisers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us, and our efforts to establish long-term commitments may not succeed.

Our advertising customers range from small businesses to well-known brands, including advertising resellers. Many of our customers spend a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us, but some customers have devoted meaningful budgets that contribute more significantly to our total revenue. In addition, advertisers may view some of our advertising solutions as experimental and unproven, or prefer certain of our products over others. Advertisers, including our customers who have devoted meaningful advertising budgets to our product, will not continue to do business with us if we do not deliver advertisements in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. As our business continues to develop, there may be new or existing customers, including from different geographic regions, that contribute more significantly to our total revenue, and a loss of such customers or a significant reduction in how much they spend with us could adversely impact our business. Any economic or political instability, whether as a result of the macroeconomic climate or the implementation of tariffs by the United States or other governments, war or other armed conflict, terrorism, or otherwise, in a specific country or region, may negatively impact the global or local economy, advertising ecosystem, our customers and their budgets with us, or our ability to forecast our advertising revenue, and could seriously harm our business.

Moreover, we rely heavily on our ability to collect, process, and disclose data and metrics to our customers so we can attract new customers and retain existing customers. Any restriction, whether by law, regulation, policy, or other

reason, on our ability to collect, process, and disclose data and metrics that our customers find useful would impede our ability to attract and retain advertisers. Regulators in many countries in which we operate or have users are increasingly scrutinizing and regulating the collection, use, and sharing of personal data related to advertising, which could materially impact our revenue and seriously harm our business. Many of these laws and regulations expand the rights of individuals to control how their personal data is collected and processed, and place restrictions on the use of personal data of teens. The processing of personal data for personalized advertising continues to be under increased scrutiny from regulators, which includes ongoing regulatory action against large technology companies like ours, the outcomes of which may be uncertain and subject to appeal. These laws may prohibit us and our customers from advertising to teens, including based on the profiling of personal data. Other legislative proposals and present laws and regulations may also apply to our or our advertisers’ activities and require significant operational changes to our business. These laws and regulations could have a material impact on the development and deployment of AI and machine learning in the context of our targeted advertising activities. Other laws to which we are or may become subject further regulate contextual, behavioral, interest-based, or targeted advertising, making certain online advertising activities more difficult and subject to additional scrutiny. These laws grant users the right to opt-out of sharing of their personal data for certain advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration, or require parental consent to be obtained for the processing of personal data of users under a certain age and restrict tracking and use of teens’ data, including for advertising. Regulators have issued significant monetary fines in certain circumstances where the regulators alleged that appropriate consent was not obtained in connection with targeted advertising activities. In addition, legislative proposals and present laws and regulations in countries where we operate regulate the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, electronic communications, and marketing.

Furthermore, in April 2021, Apple issued an iOS update that imposed heightened restrictions on our access and use of user data by allowing users to more easily opt-out of tracking of activity across devices. Additionally, Google has in the past implemented privacy controls on its Android devices and may in the future make changes to those privacy controls similar to Apple’s prior iOS update. The changes implemented by Apple have had, and similar changes, if implemented by Google or major web browsers, like Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, would have an adverse effect on our targeting, measurement, and optimization capabilities, and in turn our ability to target advertisements and measure the effectiveness of advertisements on our services. This has resulted in, and in the future is likely to continue to result in, reduced demand and pricing for our advertising products and could seriously harm our business. The longer-term impact of these changes on the overall mobile advertising ecosystem, our competitors, our business, and the developers, partners, and advertisers within our community remains uncertain, and depending on how we, our competitors, and the overall mobile advertising ecosystem adjusts, and how our partners, advertisers, and users respond, our business could be seriously harmed. Any alternative solutions we implement are subject to rules and standards set by the owners of such mobile operating systems which may be unclear, change, or be interpreted in a manner adverse to us and require us to halt or change our solutions, any of which could seriously harm our business. In addition, if we are unable to mitigate or respond to these and future developments, and alternative solutions do not become widely adopted by our advertisers, then our targeting, measurement, and optimization capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn continue to negatively impact our advertising revenue. Our advertising revenue could also be seriously harmed by many other factors, including:

•diminished or stagnant growth, or a decline, in the total or regional number of DAUs on Snapchat;

•our inability to deliver advertisements to all of our users due to legal restrictions or hardware, software, or network limitations;

•a decrease in the amount of time spent on Snapchat, a decrease in the amount of content that our users share, or decreases in usage of our Camera, Visual Messaging, Map, Stories, and Spotlight platforms;

•our inability to create new products that sustain or increase the value of our advertisements;

•changes in our user demographics that make us less attractive to advertisers;

•lack of ad creative availability by our advertising partners;

•a decline in our available content, including if our content partners do not renew agreements, devote the resources to create engaging content, or provide content exclusively to us;

•decreases in the perceived quantity, quality, usefulness, or relevance of the content provided by us, our community, or partners;

•decreases in user response rate to application notifications received from Snapchat, whether due to decreased user appreciation for notifications generally or changes in the manner notifications are delivered by mobile operating systems, which may decrease user engagement;

•increases in resistance by users to our collecting, using, and sharing their personal data for advertising-related purposes;

•changes in our analytics and measurement solutions, including what we are permitted to collect and disclose under the terms of Apple’s and Google’s mobile operating systems, that demonstrate the value of our advertisements and other commercial content;

•competitive developments or advertiser perception of the value of our products that change the rates we can charge for advertising or the volume of advertising on Snapchat;

•product changes or advertising inventory management decisions we may make that change the type, size, frequency, or effectiveness of advertisements displayed on Snapchat or the method used by advertisers to purchase advertisements;

•adverse legal developments relating to advertising, including changes mandated or prompted by legislation, regulation, executive actions, or litigation regarding the collection, use, and sharing of personal data for certain advertising-related purposes;

•adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our founders, our partners, or other companies in our industry;

•advertiser or user perception that content published by us, our users, or our partners is objectionable;

•the degree to which users skip advertisements and therefore diminish the value of those advertisements to advertisers;

•changes in the way advertising is priced or its effectiveness is measured;

•our inability, or perceived inability, to achieve an advertiser’s intended performance metric, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, or target the appropriate audience for advertisements, including due to metric estimates published by third parties that may differ from our own metrics;

•our inability to access, collect, and disclose user’s personal data, including advertising or similar deterministic identifiers that new and existing advertisers may find useful;

•difficulty and frustration from advertisers who may need to reformat or change their advertisements to comply with our guidelines;

•volatility in the equity markets, which may reduce our advertisers’ capacity or desire for aggressive advertising spending towards growth; and

•the political, economic, and macroeconomic climate and the status of the advertising industry in general, including impacts related to labor shortages and disruptions, supply chain disruptions, banking instability, tariffs implemented by the United States or other governments, inflation, and as a result of war, terrorism, or armed conflict.

Moreover, individuals are also increasingly aware of and resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of personal data in connection with advertising. Individuals are more aware of options and certain rights related to consent and other options to opt-out of such data processing, including through media attention about privacy and data protection. Some users have opted out of allowing us to combine certain data from third-party apps and websites with certain data from Snapchat for advertising purposes, which has negatively impacted our ability to collect or use certain user data and our advertising partners’ ability to deliver relevant content, all of which have in the past and could again in the future negatively impact our business.

These and other factors could reduce demand for our advertising products, which may lower the prices we receive, or cause advertisers to stop advertising with us altogether. Either of these would seriously harm our business.

Snapchat depends on effectively operating with mobile operating systems, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control. Changes in our products or to those mobile operating systems, hardware, networks, regulations, or standards may seriously harm our user retention, growth, and engagement.

Because Snapchat is used primarily on mobile devices, the application must remain interoperable with popular mobile operating systems, primarily Android and iOS, application stores, and related hardware, including mobile-device cameras. The owners and operators of such mobile operating systems and application stores, primarily Google and Apple, each have approval authority over whether to feature our core products on their application stores and make available to

consumers third-party products that compete with ours. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that any approval previously provided by such owner or operator will not be rescinded in the future. Additionally, mobile devices and mobile-device cameras are manufactured by a wide array of companies. Those companies have no obligation to test the interoperability of new mobile devices, mobile-device cameras, or related devices with Snapchat, and may produce new products that are incompatible with or not optimal for Snapchat. We have no control over these mobile operating systems, application stores, or hardware, and any changes may degrade our products’ functionality, or give preferential treatment to competitive products. For instance, Apple’s iOS 18, introduced in September 2024, makes it more difficult for us to access a Snapchatter’s contact book, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to connect Snapchatters with their close friends, potentially reducing engagement on our platform. Because these changes do not apply to Apple’s iMessage app, it may put us at a competitive disadvantage. Actions by government authorities may also impact our access to these systems or hardware and could seriously harm Snapchat usage. Our competitors that control the mobile operating systems and related hardware could make interoperability of our products more difficult or display their competitive offerings more prominently than ours. Additionally, our competitors that control the standards for the application stores could make Snapchat, or certain features of Snapchat, inaccessible for a potentially significant period of time or require us to make changes to maintain access. We plan to continue to introduce new products and features regularly, including some features that may only work on the latest systems and hardware, and have experienced that it takes significant time to optimize new products and features to function with the variety of existing mobile operating systems, hardware, and standards, impacting the popularity of such products, and we expect this trend to continue.

Moreover, our products require high-bandwidth data capabilities. If the costs of data usage increase or access to cellular networks is limited, our user retention, growth, and engagement may be seriously harmed. Additionally, to deliver high-quality video and other content over mobile cellular networks, our products must work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control and which may be subject to future changes. In addition, the proposal or adoption of any laws, regulations, or initiatives that adversely affect the growth, popularity, or use of the internet, including laws governing internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our products, including by impairing our ability to retain existing users or attract new users, make Snapchat a less attractive alternative to our competitors’ applications, and increase our cost of doing business.

We may not successfully cultivate relationships with key industry participants or develop products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks, regulations, or standards. If it becomes more difficult for our users to access and use Snapchat, if our users choose not to access or use Snapchat, or if our users choose to use products that do not offer access to Snapchat, our business and user retention, growth, and engagement could be seriously harmed.

We rely on Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, or AWS, for the vast majority of our computing, storage, bandwidth, and other services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of either platform would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business.

Google and Amazon provide distributed computing infrastructure platforms for business operations, commonly referred to as a “cloud” computing service. We currently run the vast majority of our computing on Google Cloud and AWS and have built our software and computer systems to use computing, storage capabilities, bandwidth, and other services provided by Google Cloud and AWS. Our systems are not fully redundant on the two platforms. Any transition of the cloud services currently provided by either Google Cloud or AWS to the other platform or to another cloud provider would be difficult to implement and would cause us to incur significant time and expense. Given this, any significant disruption of or interference with Google Cloud or AWS, whether temporary, regular, or prolonged, would negatively impact our operations and our business would be seriously harmed. If our users or partners are not able to access Snapchat or specific Snapchat features, or encounter difficulties in doing so, due to issues or disruptions with Google Cloud or AWS, we may lose users, partners, or advertising revenue. The level of service provided by Google Cloud and AWS or similar providers may also impact our users’, advertisers’, and partners’ usage of and satisfaction with Snapchat and could seriously harm our business and reputation if the level of service decreases. Hosting costs also have and will continue to increase as our user base and user engagement grows and may seriously harm our business if we are unable to grow our revenues faster than the cost of utilizing the services of Google Cloud, AWS, or similar providers.

In addition, Google or Amazon may take actions beyond our control that could seriously harm our business, including:

•discontinuing or limiting our access to its cloud platform;

•increasing pricing terms;

•terminating or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether;

•establishing more favorable relationships or pricing terms with one or more of our competitors; or

•modifying or interpreting its terms of service or other policies in a manner that impacts our ability to run our business and operations.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be seriously harmed. If we need to license or acquire new intellectual property, we may incur substantial costs.

We aim to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, and third parties who access or contribute to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology. We, however, cannot assure you that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, or preventing unauthorized distribution, use, misuse, misappropriation, reverse engineering, or disclosure of our proprietary information, know-how, and trade secrets. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret or know-how can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome can be unpredictable. Furthermore, these agreements do not prevent our competitors or partners from independently developing offerings that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours.

We also rely on trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain-name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications to protect aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold a number of issued patents, trademarks, and copyrights in multiple jurisdictions. In the future, we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios in the future, which could require significant cash expenditures. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, third parties may design around our proprietary rights or independently develop competing technology, and pending and future trademark, copyright, and patent applications may not be approved. Moreover, we cannot ensure that the claims of any granted patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or platform and provide us with competitive advantages. Additionally, failure to comply with applicable procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar requirements could result in abandonment or lapse of the affected patent, trademark, or copyright application or registration.

Moreover, a portion of our intellectual property has been acquired or licensed from one or more third parties. While we have conducted diligence with respect to such acquisitions and licenses, because we did not participate in the development or prosecution of much of the acquired intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that our diligence efforts identified and remedied all issues related to such intellectual property, including potential ownership errors, potential errors during prosecution of such intellectual property, and potential encumbrances that could limit our ability to enforce such intellectual property rights.

Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trade secrets, know-how, and records as the laws of the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may be exposed to material risks of theft of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive information, and we may also encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. In any of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, and, if such defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits are successful, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform, or harm our reputation and brand. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new platform features, which may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and would adversely affect our ability to compete. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products, brands, content, or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations. Any of these events could seriously harm our business.

Our two co-founders have control over all stockholder decisions because they control a substantial majority of our voting stock.

Our two co-founders, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, control over 99% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2024, and Mr. Spiegel alone can exercise voting control over a majority of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, or in many instances Mr. Spiegel acting alone, have the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election, removal, and replacement of our directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

If Mr. Spiegel’s or Mr. Murphy’s employment with us is terminated, they will continue to have the ability to exercise the same significant voting power and potentially control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. Either of our co-founders’ shares of Class C common stock will automatically convert into Class B common stock, on a one-to-one basis, nine months following his death or on the date on which the number of outstanding shares of Class C common stock held by such holder represents less than 30% of the Class C common stock held by such holder on the closing of our IPO, or 32,383,178 shares of Class C common stock. Should either of our co-founders’ Class C common stock be converted to Class B common stock, the remaining co-founder will be able to exercise voting control over our outstanding capital stock. Moreover, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy have entered into a proxy agreement under which each has granted to the other a voting proxy with respect to all shares of our Class B common stock and Class C common stock that each may beneficially own from time to time or have voting control over. The proxy would become effective on either founder’s death or disability. Accordingly, on the death or incapacity of either Mr. Spiegel or Mr. Murphy, the other could individually control nearly all of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.

In addition, in October 2016, we issued a dividend of one share of non-voting Class A common stock to all our equity holders, which will prolong our co-founders’ voting control because our co-founders are able to liquidate their holdings of non-voting Class A common stock without diminishing their voting control. Furthermore, in July 2022, our board of directors approved the future declaration and payment of a special dividend of one share of Class A common stock on each outstanding share of Snap’s common stock, subject to certain triggering conditions, which triggering conditions were modified in connection with the effectiveness the settlement of a class action lawsuit in February 2024. In the future, our board of directors may, from time to time, decide to issue additional special or regular stock dividends in the form of Class A common stock, and if we do so our co-founders’ control could be further prolonged. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support. Conversely, this concentrated control could allow our co-founders to consummate such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. In addition, our co-founders may make long-term strategic investment decisions for the company and take risks that may not be successful and may seriously harm our business.

As our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Spiegel has control over our day-to-day management and the implementation of major strategic investments of our company, subject to authorization and oversight by our board of directors. As board members and officers, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy owe a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As stockholders, even controlling stockholders, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are entitled to vote their shares, and shares over which they have voting control, in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. We have not elected to take advantage of the “controlled company” exemption to the corporate governance rules for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE.

Macroeconomic uncertainties, including labor shortages and disruptions, supply chain disruptions, banking instability, inflation, and recession risks, have in the past and may continue to adversely impact our business.

Global economic and business activities have in the past and may continue to face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, including labor shortages and disruptions, supply chain disruptions, banking instability, tariffs, inflation, and recession risks, which may continue for an extended period, and some of which have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, many aspects of our business.

As some of our advertisers experienced downturns or uncertainty in their own business operations and revenue, they halted or decreased or may halt, decrease, or continue to decrease, temporarily or permanently, their advertising spending or may focus their advertising spending more on other platforms, all of which may result in decreased advertising revenue. Labor shortages and disruptions, supply chain disruptions, banking instability, and inflation have in the past and may continue to cause logistical challenges, increased input costs, inventory constraints, and liquidity uncertainty for our advertisers, which in turn may also halt or decrease advertising spending and may make it difficult to forecast our

advertising revenue. Any decline in advertising revenue or the collectability of our receivables could seriously harm our business.

As a result of macroeconomic uncertainties, our partners and community who provide content or services to us may experience delays or interruptions in their ability to create content or provide services, if they are able to do so at all. Members of our community may also alter their usage of our products and services, particularly relative to prior periods when travel restrictions were in place. A decrease in the amount or quality of content available on Snapchat, or an interruption in the services provided to us, could lead to a decline in user engagement, which could seriously harm our business.

To the extent that macroeconomic uncertainties continue to impact our business, many of the other risks described in these risk factors may be exacerbated.

Exposure to geo-political conflicts and events could put our employees and partners at substantial risk, interrupt our operations, increase costs, create additional regulatory burdens, and have significant negative macroeconomic effects, any of which could seriously harm our business.

Significant geo-political conflicts and events have had, and will likely continue to have, a substantial effect on our business and operations. We have had, and will likely continue to have, team members and their families in impacted regions who face substantial personal risk, unprecedented disruption of their lives, and uncertainty as to the future. We have provided emergency assistance and support to these team members and their families, and we expect to continue this support in the future. In addition, we have offices, hardware, and other assets in impacted regions that may be at risk of destruction or theft. We have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs to support our team members and reorganize our operations to address these ongoing challenges. In addition, our management has spent significant time and attention on these and related events. The ongoing disruptions to our team members, our management, and our operations could seriously harm our business.

Generally, during times of war and other major conflicts, we, the third parties on which we rely, and our partners are vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyberattacks, including retaliatory cyberattacks, that could seriously disrupt our business. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, attempted cyberattacks on our products, systems, and networks, which we believe are related to conflicts. We may also face retaliatory attacks by governments, entities, or individuals who do not agree with our public expressions with regards to any conflicts or support for team members. Any such attack could cause disruption to our platform, systems, and networks, result in security breaches or data loss, damage our brand, or reduce demand for our services or advertising products. In addition, we may face significant costs (including legal and litigation costs) to prevent, correct, or remediate any such breaches. We may also be forced to expend additional resources monitoring our platform for evidence of disinformation or misuse in connection with the ongoing conflict.

Geo-political conflicts and events are inherently unpredictable, evolve quickly, and may have negative long-term impacts. On a macroeconomic level, geo-political conflicts may disrupt trade, intensify problems in the global supply chain, and contribute to inflationary pressures. All of these factors may negatively impact the demand for advertising as companies face limited product availability, restricted sales opportunities, and condensed margins. Any pause or reduction in advertising spending in connection with geo-political conflicts or events could negatively impact our revenue and harm our business.

If we do not develop successful new products or improve existing ones, our business will suffer. We may also invest in new lines of business that could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue.

Our ability to engage, retain, and increase our user base and to increase our revenue will depend heavily on our ability to successfully create new products, both independently and together with third parties. We may introduce significant changes to, or discontinue, our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products and services, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. These new products and updates may fail to increase the engagement of our users, advertisers, or partners, may subject us to increased regulatory requirements or scrutiny, and may even result in short-term or long-term decreases in such engagement by disrupting existing user, advertiser, or partner behavior or by introducing performance and quality issues. For example, in January 2023, we made changes to our advertising platform, which we believe will lay the foundation for future growth, but which have been disruptive to our customers and how some of them utilized our platform. The short- and long-term impact of any major change, or even a less significant change such as a refresh of the application or a feature change, is difficult to predict. Although we believe that these decisions will benefit the aggregate user experience and improve our

financial performance over the long term, we may experience disruptions or declines in our DAUs or user activity broadly or concentrated on certain portions of our application. Product innovation is inherently volatile, and if new or enhanced products fail to engage our users, advertisers, or partners, or if we fail to give our users meaningful reasons to return to our application, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, any of which may seriously harm our business in the short-term, long-term, or both.

Because our products created new ways of communicating, they have often required users to learn new behaviors to use our products, or to use our products repeatedly to receive the most benefit. These new behaviors, such as swiping and tapping in the Snapchat application, are not always intuitive to users. This can create a lag in adoption of new products and new user additions related to new products. We believe this has not hindered our user growth or engagement, but that may be the result of a large portion of our user base being in a younger demographic and more willing to invest the time to learn to use our products most effectively. To the extent that future users, including those in older demographics, are less willing to invest the time to learn to use our products, and if we are unable to make our products easier to learn to use, our user growth or engagement could be affected, and our business could be harmed. We may also develop new products or initiatives that increase user engagement and costs without increasing revenue in the short- or long-term.

In addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in new lines of business, new products, evolving the user experience, and other initiatives to increase our user base and user activity, and attempt to monetize the platform. For example, in 2022, we launched Snapchat+, a subscription product that gives subscribers access to exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features, and Snapchat for Web, a browser-based product that brings Snapchat’s signature capabilities to the web, in 2023, we launched My AI, an artificial intelligence powered chatbot, and in 2024, we began testing Simple Snapchat, a new and simplified version of our service. Such new lines of business, new products, evolving user experiences, and other initiatives may be costly, difficult to operate and monetize, increase regulatory scrutiny and product liability and litigation risk, and divert management’s attention, and there is no guarantee that they will be positively received by our community, attract or retain users, generate sufficient revenue or operating margin, or provide positive returns on our investment. For example, Simple Snapchat offers several new features, such as reducing the number of tabs in the application and creating a unified content feed. Although we believe these changes will create an improved user experience, we are still testing and do not know how users or advertisers will adapt or respond to these changes, and whether these changes will ultimately improve our business. Any adverse response to these changes by users or advertisers could seriously harm our business. We frequently launch new products and the products that we launch may have technical issues that diminish the performance of our application, experience product failures, or become subject to product recalls. These performance issues or issues that we encounter in the future could impact our user engagement. In addition, new products or features that we launch may ultimately prove unsuccessful or no longer fit with our priorities, and may be eliminated in the future. Such eliminations may require us to reduce our workforce and incur significant expenses. In certain cases, new products that we develop may require regulatory approval prior to launch or may require us to comply with additional regulations or legislation, including laws that are rapidly changing. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such regulatory approval, and our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and divert management’s time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. If we do not successfully develop new approaches to monetization or meet the expectations of our users or partners, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated or recover any associated development costs, and our business could be seriously harmed.

Our business is highly competitive. We face significant competition that we anticipate will continue to intensify. If we are not able to maintain or improve our market share, our business could suffer.

We face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business both domestically and internationally, especially because our products and services operate across a broad list of categories, including camera, visual messaging, content, and augmented reality. Our competitors range from smaller or newer companies to larger, more established companies such as Alphabet (including Google and YouTube), Apple, ByteDance (including TikTok), Kakao, LINE, Meta (including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp), Naver (including Snow), Pinterest, Tencent, and X (formerly Twitter). Our competitors also include platforms that offer, or will offer, a variety of products, services, content, and online advertising offerings that compete or may compete with Snapchat features or offerings. For example, Instagram, a competing application owned by Meta, has incorporated many of our features, including a “stories” feature that largely mimics our Stories feature and may be directly competitive. Meta has introduced, and likely will continue to introduce, more private ephemeral products into its various platforms which mimic other aspects of Snapchat’s core use case. We also compete for users and their time, so we may lose users or their attention not only to companies that offer products and services that specifically compete with Snapchat features or offerings, but to companies with products or services that target or otherwise appeal to certain demographics, such as Discord or Roblox. Moreover, in emerging international markets, where mobile devices often lack large storage capabilities, we may compete with other applications for the limited

space available on a user’s mobile device. We also face competition from traditional and online media businesses for advertising budgets. We compete broadly with the products and services of Alphabet, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, Pinterest, and X (formerly Twitter), and with other, largely regional, social media platforms that have strong positions in particular countries. As we introduce new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.

Many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader global recognition, and occupy stronger competitive positions in certain market segments, than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in market requirements better than we can, undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or adopt more aggressive pricing policies. In addition, ongoing changes to privacy and data protection laws and mobile operating systems have made it more difficult for us to target and measure advertisements effectively, and advertisers may prioritize the solutions of larger, more established companies. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business. Advertisers may use information that our users share through Snapchat to develop or work with competitors to develop products or features that compete with us. Certain competitors, including Alphabet, Apple, and Meta, could use strong or dominant positions in one or more market segments to gain competitive advantages against us in areas where we operate, including by:

•integrating competing social media platforms or features into products they control such as search engines, web browsers, artificial intelligence services, advertising networks, or mobile operating systems;

•making acquisitions for similar or complementary products or services; or

•impeding Snapchat’s accessibility and usability by modifying existing hardware and software on which the Snapchat application operates.

Certain acquisitions by our competitors may result in reduced functionality of our products and services, provide our competitors with valuable insight into the performance of our and our partners’ businesses, and provide our competitors with a pipeline of future acquisitions to maintain a dominant position. As a result, our competitors may acquire and engage users at the expense of our user base, growth, or engagement, which may seriously harm our business.

We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends on many factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

•the usefulness, novelty, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors’ products;

•the number and demographics of our DAUs;

•the timing and market acceptance of our products, including developments and enhancements of our competitors’ products;

•our ability to monetize our products and services, including new products and services;

•the availability of our products to users;

•the effectiveness of our advertising and sales teams;

•the effectiveness of our advertising products;

•our ability to establish and maintain advertisers’ and partners’ interest in using Snapchat;

•the frequency, relative prominence, and type of advertisements displayed on our application or by our competitors;

•the effectiveness of our customer service and support efforts;

•the effectiveness of our marketing activities;

•actual or proposed legislation, regulation, executive actions, or litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;

•acquisitions or consolidation within our industry segment;

•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented team members, particularly engineers, designers, and sales personnel;

•our ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies and assets;

•the security, or perceived security, of our products and data protection measures compared to our competitors’ products;

•our ability to cost-effectively manage and scale our operations; and

•our reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.

If we cannot effectively compete, our user engagement may decrease, which could make us less attractive to users, advertisers, and partners and seriously harm our business.

We have incurred operating losses in the past, and may not be able to attain and sustain profitability.

We began commercial operations in 2011 and we have historically experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $12.7 billion and for the year ended December 31, 2024, we had a net loss of $697.9 million. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. We may incur significant losses in the future for many reasons, including due to the other risks and uncertainties described in this report. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, operating delays, or other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our revenue does not grow at a greater rate than our expenses, our business may be seriously harmed and we may not be able to attain and sustain profitability.

The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could seriously harm our business.

We depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, the agreements are at-will, which means that they may resign or could be terminated for any reason at any time. Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy are high profile individuals who have received threats in the past and are likely to continue to receive threats in the future. Mr. Spiegel, as Chief Executive Officer, has been responsible for our company’s strategic vision and Mr. Murphy, as Chief Technology Officer, developed the Snapchat application’s technical foundation. Should either of them stop working for us for any reason, it is unlikely that the other co-founder would be able to fulfill all of the responsibilities of the departing co-founder nor is it likely that we would be able to immediately find a suitable replacement. The loss of key personnel, including members of management and key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations, adversely impact employee retention and morale, and seriously harm our business.

We cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. We face significant competition in hiring and attracting qualified engineers, designers, and sales personnel, and the change by companies to offer a remote or hybrid work environment may increase the competition for such employees from employers outside of our traditional office locations. In February 2023, we implemented our return to office plan that requires greater in-office attendance. While we intend to continue offering flexible work arrangements based on the different needs of teams across our company on a case-by-case basis, we may face difficulty in hiring and retaining our workforce as a result of this shift to have greater in-office attendance. Further, labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, inflation, other macroeconomic uncertainties, and workforce participation rates. In addition, if our reputation were to be harmed, whether as a result of our strategic decisions or media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny or otherwise, it could make it more difficult to attract and retain personnel that are critical to the success of our business. Further, negative perception of our DEI strategy, whether due to our perceived over- or under-pursuit of such initiatives, may result in issues hiring or retaining employees, as well as potential litigation or other adverse impacts.

As we continue to adapt and update our business model and priorities, or if our stock price declines, our equity awards may not be as effective an incentive to attract, retain, and motivate team members. Stock price declines may also cause us to offer additional equity awards to our existing team members to aid in retention. Furthermore, if we issue significant equity to attract and retain team members, we would incur substantial additional stock-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow or effectively manage our business and our business could be seriously harmed.

We have a continually evolving business model, which makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects and future financial results and increases the risk that we will not be successful.

We began commercial operations in 2011, began meaningfully monetizing Snapchat in 2015, and we launched Snapchat+, a paid subscription product, in 2022. We have a continually evolving business model, which makes it difficult to effectively assess our future prospects. Accordingly, we believe that investors’ future perceptions and expectations, which can be idiosyncratic and vary widely, and which we do not control, will affect our stock price. For example, investors may believe our timing and path to increased monetization will be faster or more effective than our current plans or than actually takes place. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the many challenges we face, including the ones discussed in this report.

If the security of our information technology systems or data is compromised or if our platform is subjected to cyber or other attacks that compromise user or partner accounts or frustrate or thwart our users’, partners’, or advertisers’ ability to access our products and services, our reputation and business could be seriously harmed.

In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, use, and share personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, third-party sensitive information, and intellectual property (collectively, sensitive information). Our efforts to protect our sensitive information, including information that our users, advertisers, and partners have shared with us, may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties, including traditional “black hat” hackers, nation states, nation-state supported groups, organized criminal enterprises, hacktivists, and our personnel and contractors (through theft, misuse, or other risk). We and the third parties on which we rely are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including social-engineering attacks (for example by fraudulently inducing employees, users, or advertisers to disclose information to gain access to our sensitive information, including data or our users’ or advertisers’ data, such as through the use of deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake), malware, malicious code, hacking, credential stuffing, denial of service, and other threats, including attacks enhanced or facilitated by artificial intelligence. While certain of these threats have occurred in the past, they have become more prevalent and sophisticated in our industry, and may occur in the future. Because of our prominence and value of our sensitive information, we believe that we are an attractive target for these sorts of attacks.

In particular, severe cyber extortion incidents, including ransomware attacks, are becoming increasingly prevalent. To alleviate the financial, operational, and reputational impact of these incidents, it may be preferable to make extortion payments, but we may be unwilling or unable to do so, including, for example, if applicable laws or regulations prohibit such payments. And, even if we make such payments, cyber threat actors may still disclose data, engage in further extortion, or otherwise harm our systems or data. Moreover, for certain employees we permit a hybrid work environment, which has increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as our employees utilize network connections, computers, and devices outside our premises or network, including working at home, while in transit and in public locations.

In addition, cyber threat actors have also increased the complexity of their attempts to compromise user and advertiser accounts, despite our defenses and detection mechanisms designed to prevent these account takeovers. User credentials may be obtained on- or off-platform, including through breaches of third-party platforms and services, password stealing malware, social engineering, or other tactics and techniques like credential harvesting, and used to launch individual, group, or coordinated enterprise-wide attacks. Some of these attacks may be hard to detect, including if they are at scale, and may result in cyber threat actors using our service to spam or abuse other users, access personal data, further compromise additional accounts, or engage in fraudulent advertising. Some of these attacks could also compromise employee credentials or involve socially engineering employees into granting access to systems or otherwise enabling or assisting in the cyber threat actors’ goals. Because of our global and varied user base, we may also be the target of commercial exploits and other internal and external attack methodologies by commercial spyware vendors, nation states, or nation-state supported groups, which have targeted users and the data we process about them and sought to use insiders to obtain user or employee data at peer technology companies.

We rely on third parties and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, AI, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery, and other functions. We also rely on third parties to provide other products or services to operate our business or enable features in our platform. Additionally, some advertisers and partners store sensitive information that we share with them. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place despite their contractual representations to implement such measures and our third-party provider vetting process. If these third parties fail to implement adequate data security practices or fail to comply with our terms, policies, or contractual obligations, our

sensitive information may be compromised, and we may experience adverse consequences. And even if these third parties implement data security practices and comply with various obligations, their networks may still suffer a breach, which could compromise our sensitive information. We or our third-party providers may also experience failures or malfunctions of hardware or software, the loss of technology assets, or the loss of data that, while not caused by threat actors, may have a similar impact and risk to our business. While we may be entitled to damages if the third parties on whom we rely fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, or cause the loss of our data or prolonged downtime, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award.

Moreover, our products and services, and the internal systems that support them and our business, rely on software, hardware, and other systems developed or maintained by our engineering teams and third parties (including open source software), and all of these have contained and will contain vulnerabilities, errors, bugs, or defects, which may or may not be detected by our teams or the respective third parties prior to our or their release, usage, or reliance on them. Supply chain attacks have also increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties in our supply chain have not been compromised or that their systems, networks, or code are free from exploitable vulnerabilities, errors, bugs, or defects. We take steps designed to detect and remediate vulnerabilities in our software, hardware, and information systems (including that of third parties upon which we rely), and we work with security researchers through our bug bounty program and our third party providers to help us identify vulnerabilities. We and our third party providers may not, however, detect, become aware of, and remediate all such vulnerabilities, or other bugs, errors, or defects, including on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee security researchers will disclose all vulnerabilities they become aware of or do so responsibly. Further, we and our third party providers may experience delays in developing or deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address identified vulnerabilities, bugs, errors, and defects. These could be exploited and result in a security or privacy incident, cause us to fail in our commitments to our users, advertisers, or partners, or cause a breach of or disruption of our platform, systems, networks, products, or services.

While we have implemented security measures designed to protect against cyberattacks and other security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. If any of these or similar events occur, our or our third-party partners’ sensitive information and information technology systems could be accessed, acquired, modified, destroyed, lost, altered, encrypted, or disclosed in an unauthorized, unlawful, accidental, or other improper manner, resulting in a security incident or other interruption. It may be difficult and costly to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident. Our efforts to do so may not be successful. Actions taken by us or the third parties with whom we work to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our business. Threat actors may also gain access to other networks and systems after a compromise of our networks and systems.

We have and may continue to expend significant resources or modify our business activities to adopt additional measures designed to protect against cyberattacks and other security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our systems and sensitive information.

We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, actual and attempted cyberattacks and other security incidents that impact the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of sensitive information, including as a result of insider threats, employee error, vendor breaches, and other causes. Any cyberattack or other security incident experienced by us or our third-party partners could damage our reputation and our brand, and diminish our competitive position. Applicable privacy and security obligations may require us, or we may choose, to notify relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, and investors, of security incidents, or take other actions. Such disclosures and related actions are costly and the failure to comply with applicable legal requirements could lead to adverse consequences. Governments and regulatory agencies (including the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC) have and may continue to enact new disclosure requirements for cybersecurity events. In addition, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory action against us, including class-action claims, mass arbitration demands, investigations, penalties, and audits, which could be time-consuming and cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. We could also experience loss of user or advertiser confidence in the security of our platform, additional reporting requirements or oversight, restrictions on processing sensitive information, claims by our partners or other relevant parties that we have failed to comply with contractual obligations or our policies, and indemnification obligations. We could also spend material resources to investigate or correct the incident and to prevent future incidents. Maintaining the trust of our users is important to sustain our growth, retention, and user engagement. Concerns over our privacy and security practices, whether actual or unfounded, could damage our reputation and brand and deter users, advertisers, and partners from using our products and services. Any of these occurrences could seriously harm our business.

Our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.

In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position.

Our user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may seriously harm and negatively affect our reputation and our business.

We regularly review and share metrics, including our DAUs and ARPU metrics, with our investors, advertisers, and partners to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data gathered on an analytics platform that we developed and operate and our methodologies have not in all instances been validated by an independent third party. In addition, we may change the way we measure and report metrics from time to time in connection with changes to our products, making comparisons to prior periods more difficult. While these metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our products are used across large populations globally that may require significant judgment and are subject to technical errors. For example, there may be individuals who attempt to create accounts for malicious purposes, including at scale, even though we forbid that in our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. We implement measures in our user registration process and through other technical measures to prevent, detect, and suppress that behavior, although we have not determined the number of such accounts, or the effectiveness of such measures. Our user metrics are also affected by technology on certain mobile devices that automatically runs in the background of our Snapchat application when another phone function is used, and this activity can cause our system to miscount the user metrics associated with such account.

Some of our demographic data may be incomplete or inaccurate. For example, because users self-report their dates of birth, our age-demographic data may differ from our users’ actual ages. And because users who signed up for Snapchat before June 2013 were not asked to supply their date of birth, we may exclude those users from age demographics or estimate their ages based on a sample of the self-reported ages we do have. If our users provide us with incorrect or incomplete information regarding their age or other attributes, then our estimates may prove inaccurate and fail to meet investor or advertiser expectations. In addition, our estimates for revenue by user location may also be affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user locations. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user’s IP address. If a user utilizes a proxy server or if there are other data limitations, we may not be able to accurately reflect the user’s actual location.

Errors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could also result in incorrect business decisions and inefficiencies. For instance, if a significant understatement or overstatement of active users were to occur, we may expend resources to implement unnecessary business measures or fail to take required actions to attract a sufficient number of users to satisfy our growth strategies. We count a DAU when a user visits Snapchat through our applications or websites, and only once per user per day. We have multiple pipelines of user data that we use to determine whether a user has visited Snapchat through our applications or websites during a particular day. This provides redundancy in the event one pipeline of data were to become unavailable for technical reasons, and also gives us redundant data to help measure how users interact with our application. However, we believe that we do not capture all data regarding our active users, which has in the past and may in the future result in understated metrics. This generally occurs because of technical issues, for instance when our systems do not record data from a user’s application or when a user opens the Snapchat application and contacts our servers but is not recorded as an active user. We continually seek to address these technical issues and improve our measurement processes and accuracy, such as comparing our active users and other metrics with data received from other pipelines, including data recorded by our servers and systems. But given the complexity of the systems involved and the rapidly changing nature of mobile devices and systems, we expect these issues to continue, particularly if we continue to expand in parts of the world where mobile data systems and connections are less stable. If we fail to maintain an effective analytics platform, our metrics calculations may be inaccurate. We regularly review, have adjusted in the past, and are likely to adjust in the future our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their accuracy. As a result of such adjustments, our DAUs or other metrics may not be comparable to those in prior periods. Our measures of DAU and other metrics may also differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology, data used, data limitations, or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile

populations. If advertisers, partners, or investors do not perceive our user, geographic, other demographic metrics, or measurements of advertising effectiveness to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, our reputation may be seriously harmed. Our advertisers and partners may also be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to Snapchat, which could seriously harm our business. In addition, we calculate average DAUs for a particular quarter by adding the number of DAUs on each day of that quarter and dividing that sum by the number of days in that quarter. This calculation may mask any individual days or months within the quarter that are significantly higher or lower than the quarterly average.

Improper or illegal use of Snapchat could seriously harm our business and reputation.

We cannot be certain that the technologies that we have developed to repel spamming attacks will be able to eliminate all spam messages from our products. Spammers attempt to use our products to send targeted and untargeted spam messages to users, which may embarrass, offend, threaten, or annoy users and make our products less user friendly. Our actions to combat spam may also divert significant time and focus from improving our products. As a result of spamming activities, our users may use our products less or stop using them altogether, and result in continuing operational cost to us.

Similarly, terrorists, criminals, and other bad actors may use our products to promote their goals and encourage users to engage in terror and other illegal activities discussed in our Transparency Report. We expect that as more people use our products, these bad actors will increasingly seek to misuse our products. Although we invest resources to combat these activities, including by suspending or terminating accounts we believe are violating our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, we expect these bad actors will continue to seek ways to act inappropriately and illegally on Snapchat. Maintaining a safe platform, including by combating these bad actors, requires us to incur costs, which may be significant. In addition, we may not be able to control or stop Snapchat from becoming the preferred application of use by these bad actors, which may seriously harm our reputation or lead to lawsuits or attention from regulators. If these activities continue on Snapchat, our reputation, user growth and user engagement, and operational cost structure could be seriously harmed.

Because we store, process, and use data, some of which contains personal data, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, executive actions, rules, contractual obligations, policies, and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection, content regulation, and other matters. Many of these obligations are subject to change and to uncertain interpretation, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could result in investigations, claims (including class actions), mass arbitration demands, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, or other adverse consequences, any of which could seriously harm our business.

In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, use, and share personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, third-party sensitive information, and intellectual property. Accordingly, we are subject to a variety of laws, regulations, industry standards, policies, contractual requirements, executive actions, and other obligations relating to privacy, security, and data protection. We also are and may in the future be subject to many federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to privacy, rights of publicity, content, data protection, AI, intellectual property, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, employment, money transmission, import and export restrictions, gift cards, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, advertising, algorithms, encryption, and taxation.

Under certain of these laws, we could face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions, substantial monetary fines, or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized to represent their interests. The transfer of personal data continues to be under increased regulatory attention and scrutiny, and certain jurisdictions in which we operate have significantly limited the lawful basis on which personal data can be transferred to other jurisdictions and increased the assessments required to do so. We have attempted to structure our operations, and the cross-border transfer mechanisms we rely on, in a manner designed to help us partially avoid some of these concerns. Some of these mechanisms are, or may in the future be, subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these mechanisms to lawfully transfer personal data in the future. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data, or if the requirements for a legally compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors, and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring

of personal data necessary to operate our business. Regulators may seek to restrict our data processing activities if they believe we have violated cross-border data transfer limitations, which would seriously harm our business. Additionally, companies like us that transfer personal data between jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups.

Legislation in certain of the countries in which we operate has imposed extensive obligations, and potential monetary fines, on entities like us that are categorized in various contexts as online service providers (including, as the case may be, social media platforms, electronic communications providers, or other similar categorizations) who enable the sharing of user‑generated content, to identify, mitigate, and manage the risks of harm to users from illegal and harmful content, such as terrorism, child sexual exploitation and abuse, and harassment or stalking. In addition, the privacy of teens’ personal data collected online, and use of commercial websites, applications, online services, or other interactive platforms, generally, are also becoming increasingly scrutinized. Regulations focused on online safety and protection of teens’ privacy online have and may in the future require us to change our services and incur costs to do so. Moreover, various laws to restrict or govern the use of commercial websites, applications, online services, or other interactive platforms by teens have passed or have been proposed, including laws prohibiting certain teen age groups from accessing social media, restricting advertising to teens, requiring age verification, requiring default teen safeguards, requiring warning labels, limiting the use of minors’ personal data, and requiring parental consent or providing for other parental controls or rights. These laws may be, or in some cases already have been, subject to legal challenges and changing interpretations, which may further complicate our efforts to comply with laws applicable to us. These new laws may result in restrictions on the use of certain of our products or services by teens, the inability to offer certain products and services to teens, decrease DAUs or user engagement in those jurisdictions, require changes to our products and services to achieve compliance, decrease our advertising and subscription revenue, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and our third-party partners, any of which could seriously harm our business.

Laws and regulations focused on privacy, security, and data protection, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws, wiretapping laws, invasion of privacy laws, and other similar laws have imposed obligations on companies that collect personal data from users, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices, expanding the requirements for handling personal data, requiring consents to process personal data in certain circumstances, and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. Such rights include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights impact our business and ability to provide our products and services, and our inability or failure to obtain consent or otherwise identify a lawful basis for data processing that is acceptable to a regulator, where required, could result in adverse consequences, including class-action litigation, regulatory enforcement, and mass arbitration demands. Certain of these laws also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These laws also allow for statutory fines for noncompliance and, in some instances, provide for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches, which may increase the likelihood and cost of data breach litigation, and could seriously harm our business.

Additionally, several jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted statutes banning or restricting the collection of biometric information. Certain of these laws provide for substantial penalties and statutory damages and have generated significant class-action activity. Although we maintain the position that our technologies do not collect any biometric information, we have in the past, and may in the future, settle these disputes to avoid potentially costly litigation and have in certain instances made changes to our products in an abundance of caution.

Privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose in the future, standards with which we are legally or contractually obligated to comply. Moreover, we are also bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. We also publish privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statements regarding data privacy and security, including statements relied on by our users, advertisers, and business partners. If these policies, materials, or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences, including class-action litigation or mass arbitration demands.

The implementation and enforcement, including through private rights of action, of these increasingly complex, onerous, or divergent laws and regulations, and the introduction, interpretation, or revision of any new such laws or regulations, with respect to privacy, security, data protection, and our industry are uncertain and may further complicate compliance efforts, lead to fragmentation of the service, increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and our third-party partners, or decrease the perceived usefulness of our service to our users and advertisers. For example, some federal

privacy laws are currently being challenged, and litigation in this space could impact the privacy rights of our community, including modifying the ability of third parties (such as government agencies and civil litigants) to obtain private communications between users, which in turn may negatively impact users’ experience, trust, and satisfaction and decrease their engagement with our products. Many of these obligations are becoming increasingly stringent and subject to rapid change and uncertain interpretation. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources, and there is no guarantee that our compliance efforts to date, or in the future, will be deemed compliant or sufficient. These obligations may necessitate changes to our products and services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In addition, these obligations may require us to change our business model. Our business model materially depends on our ability to process personal data in connection with our advertising offerings, so we are particularly exposed to the risks associated with the rapidly changing legal landscape regarding privacy, security, and data protection. For example, privacy regulators have targeted us and some of our competitors, including by investigating data processing activities and in the past have issued large fines to our competitors. Such enforcement actions may cause us to revise our business plans and operations. Moreover, we believe a number of investigations into other technology companies are currently being conducted by federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. We therefore are at heightened risk of regulatory scrutiny, as regulators focus their attention on data processing activities of companies like us, and any changes in the regulatory framework or enforcement actions, whether against us or our competitors, could require us to fundamentally change our business model, and seriously harm our business.

We may at times fail, or be perceived to have failed, in our efforts to comply with our privacy, security, and data protection obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties on which we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable privacy, security, or data protection obligations, we could face significant consequences, including government enforcement actions (such as investigations, claims, audits, and penalties), litigation (including class-action litigation) and mass arbitration demands, additional reporting requirements or oversight, bans on processing personal data, negative publicity, and orders to destroy or not use or transfer personal data. Certain regulators may prohibit our use of certain personal data as a result of enforcement actions or similar proceedings. Plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, including loss of users and advertisers, inability to process personal data or operate in certain jurisdictions, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could seriously harm our business.

We have in the past been subject to enforcement actions, investigations, proceedings, orders, or various government inquiries regarding our data privacy and security practices and processing. For example, in December 2014, the FTC resolved an investigation into some of our early practices by issuing a final order. That order requires, among other things, that we establish a robust privacy program to govern how we treat user data. During the 20-year term of the order, we must complete biennial independent privacy audits. The FTC has continued to review our practices and in January 2025, announced the referral of a complaint to the DOJ pertaining to our deployment of our My AI feature and the allegedly resulting risk of harm to young users. While we believe we have meritorious defenses to any legal proceedings that may arise out of this complaint, we will continue to cooperate with regulatory authorities. Any enforcement action related to this matter, or any violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could seriously harm our business.

We use AI, including generative AI, in consumer-facing features of our products and services and in the operation of our business, which may result in legal liability and privacy and security risks which may adversely impact our business.

We use AI, including generative AI, in consumer-facing features of our products and services, such as My AI, and in the operation of our business. The development, deployment, training, use, safety, and personal data processing of AI presents various AI, privacy, and security risks that impact our business.

AI development, deployment, training, use, safety, and personal data processing is subject to new and evolving privacy and data security laws, as well as increasing AI laws and review by various governmental and regulatory agencies. We are, have been, and could in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries relating to the use and operation of AI. While such regulatory inquiries have not adversely impacted our business to date, given the current unsettled nature of the legal and regulatory environment surrounding AI, our or our partners’ AI development, deployment, training, use, safety, and personal data processing of AI could subject us to further regulatory inquiries or actions, which could result in product

restrictions, fines and penalties, equitable remedies such as requirements to retrain or disgorge our AI, as well as litigation and reputational harm, any of which could seriously harm our business and require us to expend significant resources. Such consequences, if imposed, may also make it harder for us to use AI in our product and services, or internally in our business operations, which could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, certain enacted and proposed regulations related to AI could impose onerous obligations on our business, products, and services, including restrictions on or transparency obligations with respect to the training and use of AI-related systems, and obligations relating to labeling and provenance of AI-generated content. If applicable, such obligations may require us to change our products or business practices in order to comply. Additionally, if our AI products fail to perform as intended, or produce outputs that are harmful, misleading, inaccurate, or biased, in addition to the risks above, our business may be harmed.

Our financial condition and results of operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes them difficult to predict.

Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely on our past quarterly results of operations as indicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving market segments. Our financial condition and results of operations in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:

•our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement;

•the development and introduction of new or redesigned products or services by us or our competitors;

•the ability of our cloud service providers to scale effectively and timely provide the necessary technical infrastructure to offer our service;

•our ability to attract and retain advertisers in a particular period;

•seasonal or other fluctuations in spending by our advertisers and product usage by our users, each of which may change as our product offerings evolve or as our business grows or as a result of unpredictable events such as labor shortages and disruptions, supply chain disruptions, banking instability, inflationary pressures, or geo-political conflicts;

•restructuring or other charges and unexpected costs or other operating expenses;

•the number of advertisements shown to users;

•the pricing of our advertisements and other products;

•the effectiveness, and our ability to demonstrate to advertisers the effectiveness, of our advertisements;

•the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond current advertising;

•increases in marketing, sales, research and development, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;

•our ability to maintain operating margins, cash provided by operating activities, and Free Cash Flow;

•our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our physical products and adequately manage inventory;

•system failures or security incidents, and the costs associated with such incidents and remediations;

•inaccessibility of Snapchat, or certain features within Snapchat, due to third-party or governmental actions;

•stock-based compensation expense;

If we are unable to continue to maintain or successfully grow our user base and further monetize our products, our business will suffer.

We have made, and are continuing to make, investments to enable users, partners, and advertisers to create compelling content and deliver advertising to our users. Existing and prospective Snapchat users and advertisers may not be successful in creating content that leads to and maintains user engagement. We are continuously seeking to balance the objectives of our users and advertisers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience. We do not seek to monetize all of our products nor do we solely focus our efforts on users with higher ARPU, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain users and advertisers. We focus on growing engagement across our service, and from time to time our efforts may reduce user activity with certain monetizable products in favor of other products we do not currently monetize. If we are not successful in our efforts to grow or effectively and timely monetize our user base, or if we are unable to build and maintain good relations with our advertisers, our user growth and user engagement and our business may be seriously harmed. In addition, we may expend significant resources to launch new products that we are unable to monetize, which may seriously harm our business.

Additionally, we may not succeed in further monetizing Snapchat. We currently primarily monetize Snapchat by displaying advertisements sold by us and our partners. As a result, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue could be seriously harmed if:

•we fail to increase or maintain DAUs, especially in regions where we have higher monetization;

•our user growth outpaces our ability to monetize our users, including if we don’t attract sufficient advertisers or if our user growth occurs in markets that are not as monetizable;

•we fail to increase or maintain the amount of time spent on Snapchat, the amount of content that our users share, or the usage of our Camera, Visual Messaging, Map, Stories, and Spotlight platforms;

•partners and users do not create sufficient engaging content for users or partners do not renew their agreements with us;

•we fail to attract sufficient advertisers to utilize our self-serve platform to make the best use of our advertising inventory;

•advertisers do not continue to introduce engaging advertisements;

•advertisers reduce their advertising on Snapchat;

•we fail to maintain good relationships with advertisers or attract new advertisers, or demonstrate to advertisers the effectiveness of advertising on Snapchat;

•the content on Snapchat does not maintain or gain popularity; or

•we fail to attract prospective subscribers to Snapchat+, retain existing subscribers, or effectively continue to monetize Snapchat+.

We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth or changes to our business.

The growth and expansion of our business, headcount, and products create significant challenges for our management, including managing multiple relationships with users, advertisers, partners, and other third parties, and constrain operational and financial resources. If our operations or the number of third-party relationships continues to grow, our information-technology systems and our internal controls and procedures may not adequately support our operations and may require significant investments of time and capital to improve. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing large global business operations, so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems and effectively expand, train, and manage our employee base. However, the actions we take to achieve such improvements may not have the intended effect and may instead result in disruptions, delays in new products, employee turnover, declines in revenue, and other adverse effects.

As we continue to adapt and update our business model and priorities and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may also find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance and seriously harm our business.

We periodically make changes to our business and priorities. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, we undertook a restructuring of our business to focus on our top priorities, improve cost efficiencies, and drive toward profitability and positive free cash flow. As we continue to adapt and update our business model and priorities, we may make additional restructurings, reprioritizations, or workforce reductions in the future. Any such changes could disrupt our operations, increase costs, make it harder to service our users or customers, adversely impact employee retention, hiring, and morale, negatively impact our reputation, or distract management, any of which could seriously harm our business.

Our costs may increase faster than our revenue, which could seriously harm our business or increase our losses.

Providing our products to our users is costly, and we expect our expenses, including those related to people, research and development, and hosting, to grow in the future. This expense growth will continue as we broaden our user base, as users increase the number of connections and amount of content they consume and share, as we develop and implement new product features that require more computing infrastructure or products that are not revenue generating, and as we grow our business. Historically, our costs have increased each year due to these factors, and we expect to continue to incur increasing costs. Our costs are based on development and release of new products and the addition of users and may not be offset by a corresponding growth in our revenue. We will continue to invest in our global infrastructure to provide our products quickly and reliably to all users around the world, including in countries where we do not expect significant short-term monetization, if any. Our expenses may be greater than we anticipate, and our investments to make our business and our technical infrastructure more efficient may not succeed and may outpace monetization efforts. In addition, we expect to increase marketing, sales, and other operating expenses, such as legal and insurance expenses, to grow and expand our operations, remain competitive, and respond to increasing litigation and regulatory matters. Increases in our costs without a corresponding increase in our revenue would increase our losses and could seriously harm our business and financial performance.

Our business depends on our ability to maintain and scale our technology infrastructure. Any significant disruption to our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and decrease in user engagement, and seriously harm our business.

Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve users depends on the reliable performance of Snapchat and our underlying technology infrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products and services from time to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages caused by us or other service providers that could seriously harm our business. If Snapchat is unavailable when users attempt to access it, or if it does not load as quickly as they expect, users may not return to Snapchat as often in the future, or at all. As our user base and the volume and types of information shared on Snapchat grow, we will need an increasing amount of technology infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our users’ needs which could significantly increase our costs. It is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technology infrastructure to

accommodate these increased demands, or that improving our current technology infrastructure will require significant resources and delay or hinder the development of other products or services. In addition, our business is subject to interruptions, delays, and failures resulting from earthquakes, other natural disasters, geo-political conflicts, terrorism, pandemics, and other catastrophic events. Global climate change could also result in natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects, which could cause business interruptions. Wars or other armed conflicts could damage or diminish our access to our technology infrastructure or regional networks and disrupt our services, which could seriously harm our business and financial performance.

As discussed in these risk factors, substantially all of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties, including Google Cloud and AWS. We also rely on third parties for other technology related services, including certain AI functions. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could seriously harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face may seriously harm our business. And because we exercise little control over these providers, we are vulnerable to problems with the services they provide and increases in the costs of these services.

We periodically augment and enhance our financial systems and we may experience difficulties in managing our systems and processes, which could disrupt our operations, the management of our finances, and the reporting of our financial results, which in turn, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast and report our results, each of which could seriously harm our business.

Our business emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes long-term user engagement over short-term financial condition or results of operations. That strategy may yield results that sometimes don’t align with the market’s expectations. If that happens, our stock price may be negatively affected.

Our business is growing and becoming more complex, and our success depends on our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. We believe our culture fosters this goal. Our focus on innovations and quick reactions could result in unintended outcomes or decisions that are poorly received by our users, advertisers, or partners. We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to develop and launch new products and services and we cannot assure you that users will purchase or use such new products and services in the future. We will also continue to attempt to find effective ways to show our community new and existing products and alert them to events, holidays, relevant content, and meaningful opportunities to connect with their friends. These methods may provide temporary increases in engagement that may ultimately fail to attract and retain users. Our culture also prioritizes our long-term user engagement over short-term financial condition or results of operations. We frequently make decisions that may reduce our short-term revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions benefit the aggregate user experience and improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we monitor how advertising on Snapchat affects our users’ experiences to attempt to ensure we do not deliver too many advertisements to our users, and we may decide to decrease the number of advertisements to increase our users’ satisfaction in the product. In addition, we improve Snapchat based on feedback provided by our users, advertisers, and partners. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our user growth, retention and engagement on our service or on certain platforms, our relationships with advertisers and partners, and our business could be seriously harmed.

Some of our software and systems contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary applications.

We use software licensed to us by third-party developers under “open source” licenses in connection with the development or deployment of our products and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. Some open source licenses contain express requirements or impose conditions, which may be triggered under certain circumstances, with respect to the exploitation of proprietary source code or other intellectual property by users of open source software. While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and to avoid using the open source software in a manner that would put our valuable proprietary source code at risk, there is a risk that we could have used, or may in the future use, open source software in a manner which could require us to release our proprietary source code to users of our software or to the public, require us to license our proprietary software for purposes of making modifications or derivative works, or prohibit us from charging fees for the use of our proprietary software. This could result in loss of revenue, and allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development costs, and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products. If we were to

receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software, which may divert resources away from our product development efforts and, as a result, adversely affect our business. In addition, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products for certain uses, or cease offering the products associated with such software, which may be costly.

In addition, our use of open source software may present greater risks than use of other third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. To the extent that our e-commerce capabilities and other business operations depend on the successful and secure operation of open source software, any undetected or unremediated vulnerabilities, errors, or defects in open source software that we use could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our systems and injure our reputation. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our systems. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could have an adverse effect on our business.

If our users do not continue to contribute content or their contributions are not perceived as valuable to other users, we may experience a decline in user growth, retention, and engagement on Snapchat, which could result in the loss of advertisers and revenue.

Our success depends on our ability to provide Snapchat users with engaging content, which in part depends on the content contributed by our users. If users, including influential users such as world leaders, government officials, celebrities, athletes, journalists, sports teams, media outlets, and brands, do not continue to contribute engaging content to Snapchat, our user growth, retention, and engagement may decline. That, in turn, may impair our ability to maintain good relationships with our advertisers or attract new advertisers, which may seriously harm our business.

Differing government initiatives and restrictions in regions in which our products and services are offered could seriously harm our business.

Foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. In addition, federal, state, and local governments in the United States have taken increasingly divergent approaches to legislating, regulating, and taking enforcement action with respect to technologies that are related to our products and services, including considering or passing laws and regulations that are different than those applicable to other regions in the United States. Foreign governments may censor Snapchat in their countries, restrict access to Snapchat from their countries entirely, impose age-based restrictions on access to Snapchat, impose other restrictions that may affect their citizens’ ability to access Snapchat for an extended period of time or even indefinitely, require data localization, or impose other laws or regulations that we cannot comply with, would be difficult for us to comply with, or would require us to rebuild our products or the infrastructure for our products. Federal, state, or local governments in the United States have taken and may continue to take similar steps. Such restrictions may also be implemented or lifted selectively to target or benefit other companies or products, which may result in sudden or unexpected fluctuations in competition in regions where we operate. In addition, geo-political conflicts may cause countries to target and restrict our operations, or to promote other companies’ products in place of ours. Any restriction on access to Snapchat due to government actions or initiatives, or any withdrawal by us from certain countries or regions because of such actions or initiatives, or any increased competition due to actions and initiatives of governments would adversely affect our DAUs, including by giving our competitors an opportunity to penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access or to which they previously did not have access. As a result, our user growth, retention, and engagement may be seriously harmed, and we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our business could be seriously harmed.

Our users may increasingly engage directly with our partners and advertisers instead of through Snapchat, which may negatively affect our revenue and seriously harm our business.

Using our products, some partners and advertisers not only can interact directly with our users but can also direct our users to content on third-party websites or downloads of third-party applications. In addition, our users may generate content by using Snapchat features, but then share, use, or post the content on a different platform. The more our users engage with third-party websites and applications, the less engagement we may get from them, which would adversely affect the revenue we could earn from them. Although we believe that Snapchat reaps significant long-term benefits from increased user engagement with content on Snapchat provided by our partners, these benefits may not offset the possible loss of advertising revenue, in which case our business could be seriously harmed.

If events occur that damage our brand or reputation, our business may be seriously harmed.

We have developed a brand that we believe has contributed to our success. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our user base, advertisers, and partners. Because many of our users join Snapchat on the invitation or recommendation of a friend or family member, one of our primary focuses is on ensuring that our users continue to view Snapchat and our brand favorably so that these referrals continue. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, novel, fun, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introduce new products, make changes to existing products and services, or require our users to agree to new terms of service related to new and existing products that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brand in the short-term, long-term, or both. Additionally, our partners’ actions may affect our brand if users do not appreciate what those partners do on Snapchat. We may also fail to adequately support the needs of our users, advertisers, or partners, which could erode confidence in our brand. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business may be seriously harmed.

In the past, we have experienced, and we expect that we will continue to experience, media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny. Negative public perception regarding us (including regarding our privacy or security practices, products, corporate viewpoints, illicit use of our products, litigation, or employee matters, or regarding the actions of our founders, our partners, our users, or other companies in our industry) or unfavorable legislative, litigation, or regulatory actions could seriously harm our reputation and brand, and result in decreased revenue, fewer application installs (or increased application un-installs), or declining engagement or growth rates. For example, new laws may increase the minimum age at which individuals are able to access our products or require parental consent for the use of our products. In addition, parental or general public perception of our industry or Snapchat in particular could adversely affect the size, demographics, engagement, and loyalty of our user base, any of which could seriously harm our business.

Expanding and operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention. If we are not successful in expanding and operating our business in international markets, we may incur significant costs, damage our brand, or need to lay off team members in those markets, any of which may seriously harm our business.

We have expanded to new international markets and are growing our operations in existing international markets, which may have very different cultures and commercial, legal, and regulatory systems than where we predominantly operate. In connection with our international expansion and growth, we also hire new team members in many of these markets. This international expansion may:

•impede our ability to continuously monitor the performance of all of our team members;

•result in hiring of team members who may not yet fully understand our business, products, and culture; or

•cause us to expand in markets that may lack the culture and infrastructure needed to adopt our products.

These issues may eventually lead to turnover or layoffs of team members in these markets and may harm our ability to grow our business in these markets. In addition, scaling our business to international markets imposes complexity on our business, and requires additional financial, legal, and management resources. We may not be able to manage growth and expansion effectively, which could damage our brand, result in significant costs, and seriously harm our business. For example, in recent years we undertook a broad strategic reprioritization to focus on our top priorities, improve cost efficiencies, and drive toward profitability and positive free cash flow. As we continue to adapt and update our business model and priorities, we may make additional restructurings, reprioritizations, or workforce reductions in the future. Any such changes could disrupt our operations, increase costs, make it harder to service our users or customers, adversely impact employee retention, hiring and morale, negatively impact our reputation, or distract management, any of which could seriously harm our business.

Additionally, because we have team members internationally, we are exposed to political, social, and economic instability in additional countries and regions.

Our products are highly technical and may contain undetected software vulnerabilities, bugs, hardware errors, or defects, which could manifest in ways that could seriously harm our reputation and our business.

Our products are highly technical and complex. Snapchat, our other products, or products we may introduce in the future, may contain undetected software bugs, hardware errors, and other vulnerabilities. These bugs and errors can manifest in any number of ways in our products, including through diminished performance, security vulnerabilities,

malfunctions, or even permanently disabled products. We have a practice of updating our products, but some errors in our products may be discovered only after a product has been released or shipped and used by users, and may in some cases be detected only under certain circumstances or after extended use. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our products or code (particularly after release) could damage our reputation, result in a security incident (and attendant consequences), drive away users, lower revenue, and expose us to litigation claims or regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, any of which could seriously harm our business. We may also experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address identified vulnerabilities.

Spectacles, as an eyewear product, is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and may malfunction in a way that results in physical harm to a user or others around the user. We offer a limited one-year warranty in the United States and a limited two-year warranty in Europe, and any such defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in a loss of sales and users, which could seriously harm our business. Moreover, certain jurisdictions in which we operate require manufacturers of connected devices to comply with legal and contractual obligations that govern the way data generated by such connected devices is shared and used. If we are unable to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, or if we face technical difficulties in the implementation of some requirements, we could become subject to investigations and enforcement actions, which could require additional financial and management resources.

We may face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty, or experience product recalls. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, we voluntarily decided to recall our Pixy drone product and refund consumers after determining that, in a very small number of cases, the batteries overheated. The product had been discontinued in August 2022. Our product contracts with users contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. In addition, our liability insurance coverage may prove inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all. The occurrence of any of these events could increase our costs, divert management attention, and seriously harm our reputation and our business.

We have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to regulatory inquiries, investigations, and proceedings which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a way that could seriously harm our business.

We have been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to inquiries, investigations, and proceedings instituted by government entities on a variety of topics, including data privacy, AI, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and the use of our platform for illegal purposes. We regularly report information about our business to federal, state, and foreign regulators in the ordinary course of operations and have, and may in the future, receive additional requests for information regarding our business practices. These actions, including any potential unfavorable outcomes, and our compliance with any associated regulatory orders, consent decrees, or settlements, may require us to change our products, product offerings and features, policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary fines or other penalties or sanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation, and require us to incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business. For example, in January 2025, the FTC referred a complaint against us to the DOJ that pertains to our deployment of our My AI feature and the allegedly resulting risk of harm to young users. While we believe we have meritorious defenses to any legal proceedings that may arise out of this complaint, we will continue to cooperate with regulatory authorities. Any enforcement action related to this matter, or any violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could seriously harm our business.

We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property claims that are expensive and time-consuming. If resolved adversely, these lawsuits and claims could seriously harm our business.

Companies in the mobile, camera, communication, media, internet, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and other technology-related industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various “non-practicing entities” and other entities that own patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights to extract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce new products or make other business changes, including in areas where we currently do not compete, which could increase our exposure to patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings from holders of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights alleging that some of our products or content infringe their rights. An unfavorable outcome in any of these lawsuits could seriously harm our business. If these or

other matters continue in the future or we need to enter into licensing arrangements, which may not be available to us or on terms favorable to us, it may increase our costs and decrease the value of our products, and our business could be seriously harmed. If a third party does not offer us a license to its intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be required to develop, acquire or license alternative, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time, effort, and expense, and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events would adversely affect our business.

Moreover, we may not be aware if our platform is infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property rights, and third parties may bring claims alleging such infringement, misappropriation, or violation. Because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products and there is also a risk that we could adopt a technology without knowledge of a pending patent application, which technology would infringe a third-party patent once that patent is issued. Moreover, the law continues to evolve and be applied and interpreted by courts in novel ways that we may not be able to adequately anticipate, and such changes may subject us to additional claims and liabilities. In a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents and our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement or invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a lower burden of proof. Intellectual property claims, whether or not successful, could divert management time and attention away from our business and harm our reputation and financial condition. Moreover, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business.

We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to lawsuits contending that we should be legally responsible for content created by our users or harms experienced by our users. These lawsuits can be expensive and time-consuming. If resolved adversely, these lawsuits and claims could seriously harm our business.

We rely on a variety of Constitutional, statutory, and common-law frameworks that provide that we are not legally responsible for content created by our users, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, the First Amendment, and the fair-use doctrine. However, these provisions, statutes, and doctrines are subject to uncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. For example, the U.S. Congress amended the CDA in 2018 in ways that could expose some Internet platforms to an increased risk of litigation. In addition, the U.S. Congress and the Executive branch have proposed further changes or amendments to the CDA each year since 2019 including, among other things, proposals that would narrow the scope of CDA protection, expand government enforcement power relating to content moderation concerns, or repeal the CDA altogether. Some U.S. states have also enacted or proposed legislation that would undercut, or conflict with, the CDA’s protections and implicate U.S. constitutional protections. Some of these state-specific laws grant individuals a private right of action to sue to enforce these laws, with statutory damages. Although such state laws have been or can be expected to be challenged in court, if these laws were upheld or if additional similar laws or the changes or amendments to the CDA proposed by the U.S. Congress and the Executive branch were enacted, such changes may decrease the protections provided by the CDA or previously accepted U.S. constitutional protections and expose us to lawsuits, penalties, and additional compliance obligations. If courts begin to interpret the CDA more narrowly than they have historically done, this could expose us to additional lawsuits and potential judgments and seriously harm our business. Moreover, some of these statutes and doctrines that we rely on provide protection only or primarily in the United States. If the rules around these doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our service, we could incur liability or be required to make significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, and our business could be seriously harmed.

Notwithstanding these Constitutional, statutory, and common-law protections, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products, including Snapchat. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, and personal injury torts. For example, we do not monitor or edit the vast majority of content that is communicated through Snapchat, and such content has, and may in the future, expose us to lawsuits. Specifically, we are currently facing several lawsuits alleging that we are liable for allowing users to communicate with each other, and that those communications sometimes result in harm. In addition, other lawsuits allege that the design of our platform and those of our competitors is addictive and harmful to minor users’ mental health. Other plaintiffs have argued that we should be

legally responsible for fentanyl overdoses or poisoning if communications about a drug transaction occurred on our platform. We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, but litigation is inherently uncertain. Unfavorable outcomes could seriously harm our business. These actions, including any potential unfavorable outcomes, and our compliance with any associated court orders or settlements, may require us to change our policies or practices, subject us to substantial monetary judgments, fines, penalties, or sanctions, result in increased operating costs, divert management’s attention, harm our reputation, and require us to incur significant legal and other expenses, any of which could seriously harm our business. Even if the outcome of any such litigation or claim is favorable, defending against such lawsuits is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. We may also receive unfavorable preliminary, interim, or final rulings in the course of litigation.

This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be less than the protection that exists in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states were required to implement by June 2021. In addition, legislation in Germany may impose significant fines for failure to comply with certain content removal and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes.

We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages, or license costs. We could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services. If any of these events occur, we may incur significant costs or be required to make significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations and our business could be seriously harmed.

From time to time, we are involved in class-action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time-consuming and could seriously harm our business.

We are involved in numerous lawsuits, including putative class-action lawsuits brought by users and investors, some of which may claim statutory damages. We anticipate that we will continue to be a target for lawsuits in the future. Because we have millions of users, class-action lawsuits against us that are purportedly filed by or on behalf of users typically claim enormous monetary damages in the aggregate even if the alleged per-user harm is small or non-existent.

Similarly, because we have a large number of stockholders, class-action lawsuits on securities theories typically claim enormous monetary damages in the aggregate even if the alleged loss per stockholder is small. For example, in November 2021, we, and certain of our officers, were named as defendants in a securities class-action lawsuit in federal court purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our Class A common stock. The lawsuit alleges that we and certain of our officers made false or misleading statements and omissions concerning the impact that Apple’s App Tracking Transparency, or ATT, framework would have on our business.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, but litigation is inherently uncertain and an unfavorable outcome could seriously harm our business. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that might not be reversed on appeal, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on adverse terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or changes to our products or business practices, and seriously harm our business. Even if the outcome of any such litigation or claim is favorable, defending against such lawsuits is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. We may also receive unfavorable preliminary, interim, or final rulings in the course of litigation.

We plan to continue expanding our international operations, including in markets where we have limited operating experience and may be subject to increased business and economic risks that could seriously harm our business.

We plan to continue expanding our business operations abroad and to enter new international markets and expand our operations in existing international markets, where in some cases we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products and advertisements. Our limited experience and infrastructure in such markets, or the lack of a critical mass of users in such markets, may make it more difficult for us to effectively monetize any increase in DAUs in those markets, and may increase our costs without a corresponding increase in revenue. If we fail to deploy or manage our operations in international markets successfully, our business may suffer. We do not currently enter into foreign currency exchange contracts, which means our business, financial condition, and operating results may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. In the future, as our international operations increase, or more of our revenue agreements or operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the

U.S. dollar, these impacts may become material. In addition, as our international operations and sales continue to grow, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:

•political, social, and economic instability, including war and other armed conflict, and significant political developments or disruptions in foreign jurisdictions;

•risks related to the legal and regulatory environment in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, rights of publicity, content, data protection, cybersecurity, intellectual property, communication, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, employment, money transmission, import and export restrictions, gift cards, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, advertising, algorithms, encryption, and taxation, and unexpected changes in laws, regulatory requirements, and enforcement;

•potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship and requirements to provide user information to local authorities;

•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;

•complying with tax requirements of multiple jurisdictions;

•enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;

•complying with a variety of foreign laws, including certain employment laws requiring national collective bargaining agreements that set minimum salaries, benefits, working conditions, and termination requirements;

•complying with a variety of foreign disclosure and reporting obligations, including those related to environmental, social, and corporate governance impacts and security breaches;

•reduced protection for intellectual-property rights in some countries;

•difficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;

•regulations that might add difficulties in repatriating cash earned outside the United States and otherwise preventing us from freely moving cash;

•import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;

•complying with statutory equity requirements;

•complying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions; and

•export controls and economic sanctions administered by the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or other similar foreign regulatory bodies.

If we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our business could be seriously harmed.

We plan to continue to make acquisitions and strategic investments in other companies, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, and seriously harm our business.

As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to make acquisitions to add specialized team members and complementary companies, products, and technologies, as well as investments in public and private companies in furtherance of our strategic objectives. Our ability to acquire and successfully integrate larger or more complex companies, products, and technologies is unproven. In the future, we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition or investment candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or investments on favorable terms, if at all. Our previous and future acquisitions and investments may not achieve our goals, and any future acquisitions or investments we complete could be viewed negatively by users, advertisers, partners, or investors. In addition, if we fail to successfully close transactions, integrate new teams, or integrate the products, technologies, and systems associated with these acquisitions into our company, our business could be seriously harmed. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. For example, future or past business transactions could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. We may not successfully evaluate or use the acquired products, technology, and personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or

investment transaction, including accounting charges. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities and litigation exposure that we assume as a result of acquiring companies. We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition or investment, any of which could seriously harm our business. Selling or issuing equity to finance or carry out any such acquisition or investment would also dilute our existing stockholders. Incurring debt would increase our fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations.

In addition, it generally takes several months after the closing of an acquisition to finalize the purchase price allocation. Therefore, it is possible that our valuation of an acquisition may change and result in unanticipated write-offs or charges, impairment of our goodwill, or a material change to the fair value of the assets and liabilities associated with a particular acquisition, any of which could seriously harm our business.

The strategic investments we make in public and private companies around the world range from early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and our ability to realize a return on our investment, if any, is typically dependent on the issuer participating in a liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition. We are not always able to achieve a return on our investments in a timely fashion, if at all, even for those companies that have achieved a liquidity event. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, which can include failures to achieve business objectives as well as bankruptcy, we could recognize an impairment or lose all or part of our investment.

Our acquisition and investment strategy may not succeed if we are unable to remain attractive to target companies or expeditiously close transactions. For example, if we develop a reputation for being a difficult acquirer or having an unfavorable work environment, or target companies view our non-voting Class A common stock unfavorably, we may be unable to source and close acquisition targets. In addition, members of the U.S. administration and Congress have proposed new legislation, and the FTC and Department of Justice have adopted new procedures, that could limit, hinder, or delay the acquisition process and target opportunities. If we are unable to consummate key acquisition transactions essential to our corporate strategy, it may limit our ability to grow or compete effectively and our business may be seriously harmed.

If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings, which could seriously harm our business.

Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2024, we had recorded a total of $1.8 billion of goodwill and intangible assets, net related to our acquisitions. An adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or intangible assets. Any such material charges may seriously harm our business.

Our use of equity awards to compensate and motivate our employees causes dilution to existing stockholders. Efforts to manage this dilution are likely to reduce the amount of cash we have available for other purposes.

We use equity awards that vest over multiple years to compensate and motivate our employees. When our employee equity awards vest, we typically withhold taxes and remit them, along with any employee and employer social security contributions, to relevant taxing authorities on behalf of team members and, where applicable, their employers.

While the issuance of stock-based compensation to our employees does not deplete our cash balance, it is dilutive to existing stockholders. To help manage and mitigate this dilution, we can choose to use our existing cash to fund the withholding and remittance obligations on equity awards when they vest (instead of selling a portion of the vested equity award on behalf of our employees), or engage in stock repurchases. However, doing so would reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes and may increase stock price volatility. If we were to elect to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations in whole or in part by drawing on our revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, our interest expense and principal repayment requirements could increase significantly, which could seriously harm our business.

There are numerous risks associated with our internal and contract manufacturing of our physical products and components. If we encounter problems with either our internal or contract manufacturing, we may not deliver our products within specifications or on time, which may seriously harm our business.

Manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment, and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. We largely rely on third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our own physical products and components. We and our contract manufacturers are all vulnerable to capacity constraints and reduced component availability, and have limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs, particularly when components are in short supply, or if we introduce a new product or feature. In addition, we have limited control over our suppliers’ and manufacturers’ quality systems and controls, and therefore must rely on them to meet our quality and performance standards and specifications. Delays, component shortages, including custom components that are manufactured for us at our direction, global trade conditions and agreements, and other manufacturing and supply problems could impair the distribution of our products and ultimately our brand. For example, the United States has threatened tougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or potential future imposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on certain imports from China, which may adversely affect our products and seriously harm our business.

Furthermore, any adverse change in our suppliers’ or contract manufacturers’ financial or business condition or our relationship with them could disrupt our ability to supply our products. If we change our suppliers or contract manufacturers, or shift to more internal manufacturing operations, we may lose revenue, incur increased costs, and damage our reputation and brand. Qualifying and commencing operations with a new supplier or contract manufacturer is expensive and time-consuming. In addition, if we experience increased demand for our products, we may need to increase our material or component purchases, internal or contract-manufacturing capacity, and internal test and quality functions. The inability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate high-quality materials and products could delay our order fulfillment, and may require us to change the design of our products to meet this increased demand. Any redesign may require us to re-qualify our products with any applicable regulatory bodies or customers, which would be costly and time-consuming. This may lead to unsatisfied customers and users and increase costs to us, which could seriously harm our business. As we increase or acquire additional manufacturing capacity, we are subject to many complex and evolving environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and rules in each jurisdiction in which we operate. If we fail to comply with any such laws and regulations, then we could incur regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities, suspension of production, significant compliance requirements, alteration of our manufacturing processes, or restrictions on our ability to modify or expand our facilities, any of which could seriously harm our business.

In addition, any errors or defects in any parts or technology incorporated into our products could result in product failures or recalls that could seriously harm our business. Further, any defect in manufacturing, design, or other could cause our products to fail or render them permanently inoperable. As a result of such product failures or recalls, we may have to replace or offer refunds for these products at our sole cost and expense, face litigation, including class-action lawsuits, or be subject to other liabilities. Should we have a widespread problem of this kind, the reputational damage and the cost of replacing these products, or other liabilities, could seriously harm our business.

Some of our products are in regulated industries. Clearances to market regulated products can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, for future products.

The FDA and other state and foreign regulatory agencies regulate Spectacles. We may develop future products that are regulated as medical devices by the FDA or regulated by other governmental agencies. Government authorities, primarily the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies, regulate the medical device industry. Unless there is an exemption, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA and corresponding agencies, or other applicable governmental authorities, before we can market or sell a new regulated product or make a significant modification to an existing product. Obtaining regulatory clearances to market a medical device or other regulated products can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, for future products. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for any products under development could prevent us from launching new products. We could seriously harm our business and the ability to sell our products if we experience any product problems requiring reporting to governmental authorities, if we fail to comply with applicable federal, state, or foreign agency regulations, or if we are subject to enforcement actions such as fines, civil penalties, injunctions, product recalls, or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals.

We have faced inventory risk with respect to our physical products.

We have been and may in the future be exposed to inventory risks related to our physical products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, and other factors. We try to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking inventory. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Failure to manage our inventory, supplier commitments, or customer expectations could seriously harm our business.

Risks Related to Credit and Financing

We have offered and may continue to offer credit to our partners to stay competitive, and as a result we may be exposed to credit risk of some of our partners, which may seriously harm our business.

We engage in business with some of our partners on an open credit basis. While we attempt to monitor individual partner payment capability when we grant open credit arrangements and maintain allowances we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts, we cannot assure investors these programs will be effective in managing our credit risks in the future. This may be especially true as our business grows and expands, we engage with partners that have limited operating history, or we engage with partners that we may not be familiar with. If we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business could be seriously harmed.

Operating our business requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay the Convertible Notes, and any other debt when due, which may seriously harm our business.

Our ability to make principal or interest payments on, or to refinance, the Convertible Notes or other indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and business. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, obtaining additional debt financing, or issuing additional equity securities, any of which may be on terms that are not favorable to us or, in the case of equity securities, highly dilutive to our stockholders. The Convertible Notes will mature beginning in May 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. Our ability to repay or refinance the Convertible Notes or our other indebtedness will depend on various factors, including the accessibility of capital markets, our business, and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, our existing and future debt agreements, including the Convertible Notes and Credit Facility, may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt, and would seriously harm our business.

In addition, holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes on the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Further, if a make-whole fundamental change as defined in each of the indentures governing the Convertible Notes, or the Indentures, occurs prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. On the conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments for the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make such repurchases of the Convertible Notes surrendered or pay cash with respect to the Convertible Notes being converted.

If we default on our credit obligations, our operations may be interrupted and our business could be seriously harmed.

We have a Credit Facility that we may draw on to finance our operations, acquisitions, and other corporate purposes. If we default on these credit obligations, our lenders may:

•require repayment of any outstanding amounts drawn on our Credit Facility;

•terminate our Credit Facility; or

•require us to pay significant damages.

If any of these events occur, our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations, as well as our business, could be seriously harmed. In addition, our Credit Facility contains operating covenants, including customary limitations on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, restrictions on certain intercompany transactions, and limitations on the amount of dividends and stock repurchases. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility and any future financial agreements into which we may enter. If not waived, defaults could cause our outstanding indebtedness under our outstanding Convertible Notes or our Credit Facility, including any future financing agreements that we may enter into, to become immediately due and payable. For more information on our Credit Facility, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms when needed, or at all, which could seriously harm our business.

We have historically incurred net losses and negative cash flow from operations, and we may not attain and sustain profitability in future periods. As a result, we may need additional financing. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor demand, our operating performance, our credit rating, the condition of the capital markets, and other factors. To the extent we use available funds or draw on our Credit Facility, we may need to raise additional funds and we cannot assure investors that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked, or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our Class A common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. In the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, our interest expense and principal repayment requirements could increase significantly, which could seriously harm our business. In addition, our ability to draw on our Credit Facility relies on our lenders under that facility’s continued operation and ability to fund.


### Risks Related to Taxes


Existing, new, and proposed tax laws and regulations that would affect the U.S. or foreign taxation of business activities, including the imposition of, or increase in, tax based on gross revenue, could seriously harm our business, the financial markets, and the market price of our Class A common stock.

Reforming the taxation of international businesses has been a priority for politicians at a global level, and a wide variety of changes have been proposed or enacted. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the taxation of such activities may increase our tax expense, the amount of taxes we pay, or both, and seriously harm our business. For example, legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, significantly reformed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act put into effect significant changes to U.S. taxation of international business activities, including lowering U.S. federal corporate income tax rates, changing the utilization of future net operating loss carryforwards, allowing certain capital expenditures to be expensed, eliminating the option to currently deduct research and development expenditures and requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act, or the IRA, was enacted, the provisions of which include a minimum tax equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. It is possible that changes or interpretations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the IRA, or other tax legislation, or the enactment of new tax legislation, could increase our future tax liability, which could in turn adversely impact our business and future profitability.

In addition, many jurisdictions and intergovernmental organizations have implemented or are in the process of implementing proposals that have changed (or are likely to change) various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the jurisdictions in which we do business and in which our users are located. Some jurisdictions have enacted, in some cases with retroactive effect, and others have proposed, taxes on digital services that are based on gross receipts generated from users or customers in those jurisdictions, regardless of profitability. In addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or the OECD, has led international efforts to devise, and to implement on a permanent basis, a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. Pillar One focuses on nexus and profit allocation, and Pillar Two provides for a global minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15%. Pillar One would apply to multinational enterprises with annual global revenue above 20 billion euros and profitability above 10%, with the revenue threshold potentially reduced to 10 billion euros in the future. While it remains uncertain whether Pillar One will be adopted, based on these thresholds, we currently

expect to be outside the scope of the Pillar One proposals, though we anticipate that we will be subject to Pillar One in the future if it is ultimately adopted and if our global revenue exceeds the Pillar One thresholds. A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted legislation to implement core elements of the Pillar Two proposal from the start of 2024, and further implementation is ongoing. While such legislation did not result in a material change to our income tax provision for the current year, such implementation could impact the amount of tax we have to pay and cause us to incur additional material costs and expenditures in the future to ensure compliance with any such rules in each of the relevant jurisdictions within which we carry on our business.

We continue to examine the impact these and other tax reforms may have on our business. The impact of these and other tax reforms is uncertain and one or more of these or similar measures could seriously harm our business.

We may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities, which could seriously harm our business.

Our income tax obligations are based on our corporate operating structure and third-party and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our international business activities, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to change and uncertain interpretation. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology, intercompany arrangements, or transfer pricing, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay and seriously harm our business. Taxing authorities may also determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with how we report our income, which could increase our effective tax rate and the amount of taxes we pay and seriously harm our business. In addition, our future income taxes could fluctuate because of earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal and state and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome from a review or audit could seriously harm our business. In addition, determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements for such periods and may seriously harm our business.

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited, each of which could seriously harm our business.

As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $6.1 billion, state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4.4 billion, U.K. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4.7 billion, and Singapore net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $214.0 million. We also accumulated U.S. federal and state research tax credits of $916.5 million and $523.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5% shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar ownership change rules may apply under U.S. state tax laws, as well as in the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions where we have loss carryforwards. In the event that we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of transactions in our stock, then we may be limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, net operating losses arising in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 can be carried forward to the earlier of the next subsequent twenty tax years or until such losses are fully utilized. Net operating losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 are not subject to the twenty-year limitation, but our use of such net operating losses in a tax year may not exceed 80% of such year’s taxable income. Certain U.S. states have imposed additional limitations on the use of state net operating loss carryforwards. U.S. federal research tax credits can be carried forward to the earlier of the next subsequent twenty tax years or until such credits are fully utilized, and use of those credits generally cannot exceed 75% of the net income tax liability for such tax year. In the United Kingdom, net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely; however, use of such carryforwards in a given year is generally limited to 50% of such year’s taxable income and may be subject to ownership change rules that restrict the use of net operating loss carryforwards. In Singapore, net operating loss carryforwards can also be carried forward indefinitely and are not subject to any taxable income limitation.

Any limitations on the ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets, as well as the timing of any such use, could seriously harm our business.

Our operating results may be negatively affected if we are required to pay additional sales and use tax, value added tax, digital services tax, or other transaction taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to all or a portion of past or future sales.

We currently collect and remit sales and use, value added and other transaction taxes in certain of the jurisdictions where we do business based on our assessment of the amount of taxes owed by us in such jurisdictions. However, in some jurisdictions in which we do business, we do not believe that we owe such taxes, and therefore we currently do not collect and remit such taxes in those jurisdictions or record contingent tax liabilities in respect of those jurisdictions. A successful assertion that we are required to pay additional taxes in connection with sales of our products and solutions, or the imposition of new laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations requiring the payment of additional taxes, would result in increased costs and administrative burdens for us. If we are subject to additional taxes, including digital services taxes, and determine to offset such increased costs by collecting and remitting such taxes from our customers, or otherwise passing those costs through to our customers, companies may be discouraged from purchasing our products and solutions. Any increased tax burden may decrease our ability or willingness to compete in relatively burdensome tax jurisdictions, result in substantial tax liabilities related to past or future sales or otherwise seriously harm our business.


### Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock


Holders of Class A common stock have no voting rights. As a result, holders of Class A common stock will not have any ability to influence stockholder decisions.

Class A common stockholders have no voting rights, unless required by Delaware law. As a result, all matters submitted to stockholders will be decided by the vote of holders of Class B common stock and Class C common stock. As of December 31, 2024, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy control over 99% of the voting power of our capital stock, and Mr. Spiegel alone may exercise voting control over our outstanding capital stock. Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy voting together, or in many instances, Mr. Spiegel acting alone, will have control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. In addition, because our Class A common stock carries no voting rights (except as required by Delaware law), the issuance of the Class A common stock in future offerings, in future stock-based acquisition transactions, or to fund employee equity incentive programs could prolong the duration of Mr. Spiegel’s and Mr. Murphy’s current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect certain directors and to determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated control eliminates other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.


### Our capital structure may adversely impact our stock price.


Although other U.S.-based companies have publicly traded classes of non-voting stock, to our knowledge, we were the first company to only list non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange. Some indexes have since determined that they will exclude non-voting stock, like our Class A common stock, from their membership. For example, FTSE Russell, a provider of widely followed stock indexes, requires new constituents of its indexes to have at least five percent of their voting rights in the hands of public stockholders. As a result, our Class A common stock is not eligible for FTSE Russell or other stock indexes with these or similar restrictions. We cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take a similar approach to FTSE Russell in the future. Exclusion from indexes could make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected. Additionally, the exclusion of our Class A common stock from these indexes may limit the types of investors who invest in our Class A common stock and could make the trading price of our Class A common stock more volatile.

Because our Class A common stock is non-voting, we and our stockholders are exempt from certain provisions of U.S. securities laws. This may limit the information available to holders of our Class A common stock.

Because our Class A common stock is non-voting, significant holders of our common stock are exempt from the obligation to file reports under Sections 13(d), 13(g), and 16 of the Exchange Act. These provisions generally require periodic reporting of beneficial ownership by significant stockholders, including changes in that ownership. For example, we believe that Tencent Holdings Limited, together with its affiliates, may hold greater than 10% of our Class A common stock based in part on Tencent Holdings Limited’s public reporting. As a result of our capital structure, holders are not

obligated to disclose changes in ownership of our Class A common stock, so there can be no assurance that you, or we, will be notified of any such changes. Our directors and officers are required to file reports under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Our significant stockholders, other than directors and officers, are exempt from the “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules with respect to their purchases and sales of our securities. As such, stockholders will be unable to bring derivative claims for disgorgement of profits for trades by significant stockholders under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act unless the significant stockholders are also directors or officers.

Since our Class A common stock is our only class of stock registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and that class is non-voting, we are not required to file proxy statements or information statements under Section 14 of the Exchange Act, unless a vote of the Class A common stock is required by applicable law. Accordingly, legal causes of action and remedies under Section 14 of the Exchange Act for inadequate or misleading information in proxy statements may not be available to holders of our Class A common stock. If we do not deliver any proxy statements, information statements, annual reports, and other information and reports to the holders of our Class B common stock and Class C common stock, then we will similarly not provide any of this information to holders of our Class A common stock. Because we are not required to file proxy statements or information statements under Section 14 of the Exchange Act, any proxy statement, information statement, or notice of our annual meeting may not include all information under Section 14 of the Exchange Act that a public company with voting securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act would be required to provide to its stockholders. Most of that information, however, will be reported in other public filings. For example, any disclosures required by Part III of Form 10-K as well as disclosures required by the NYSE for the year ended December 31, 2024 that are customarily included in a proxy statement are instead included in our Annual Report. But some information required in a proxy statement or information statement is not required in any other public filing. For example, we are not required to comply with the proxy access rules or the “pay versus performance” disclosure rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. If we take any action in an extraordinary meeting of stockholders where the holders of Class A common stock are not entitled to vote, we will not be required to provide the information required under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. Nor will we be required to file a preliminary proxy statement under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. Since that information is also not required in a Form 10-K, holders of Class A common stock may not receive the information required under Section 14 of the Exchange Act with respect to extraordinary meetings of stockholders. In addition, we are not subject to the “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency” provisions of the Dodd–Frank Act. As a result, our stockholders do not have an opportunity to provide a non-binding vote on the compensation of our executive officers. Moreover, holders of our Class A common stock will be unable to bring matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or nominate directors at such meeting, nor can they submit stockholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.

The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.

The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. From January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024, the trading price of our Class A common stock ranged from $7.86 to $17.90. Declines or volatility in our trading price could make it more difficult to attract and retain talent, adversely impact employee retention and morale, and has required, and may continue to require, us to issue more equity to incentivize team members which is likely to dilute stockholders. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our user growth, retention, engagement, revenue, or other operating results;

•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of investors and the financial community;

•the accuracy of our financial guidance or projections;

•any forward-looking financial or operating information we may provide, any changes in this information, or our failure to meet expectations based on this information;

•actions of investors who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any investors who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;

•significant acquisitions or divestitures of our stock by investors, whether voluntarily or to comply with regulatory or other requirements;

•whether our capital structure is viewed unfavorably, particularly our non-voting Class A common stock and the significant voting control of our co-founders;

•additional shares of our common stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders, or the anticipation of such sales, including if we issue shares to satisfy equity-related tax obligations;

•stock repurchase programs, or repurchases of the Convertible Notes, undertaken by us;

•announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;

•announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base or the level of user engagement;

•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry segment, including our partners and competitors;

•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole, inflationary pressures, banking instability, war or other armed conflict, terrorism, or responses to these events;

•lawsuits threatened or filed against us;

•developments in new legislation and pending lawsuits, executive actions, or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies, whether such developments may impact us or our competitors; and

•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, or responses to these events.

In addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’ stock prices, including ours. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class-action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, in November 2021, we, and certain of our officers, were named as defendants in a securities class-action lawsuit in federal court purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our Class A common stock. The lawsuit alleges that we and certain of our officers made false or misleading statements and omissions concerning the impact that Apple’s ATT framework would have on our business. We believe we have meritorious defenses to this lawsuit, but an unfavorable outcome could seriously harm our business. Any litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and seriously harm our business.

We may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any stock repurchase program undertaken by us and any failure to repurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price.

Our board of directors has in the past and may from time to time in the future authorize stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which repurchases of Class A common stock may be made either through open market transactions (including pre-set trading plans) or through other transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. Any repurchase programs may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.

The existence of a stock repurchase program could cause our stock price to trade higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although stock repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of any such program.

Repurchasing our Class A common stock reduces the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any stock repurchase program.

Conversions or exchanges of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise affect the market price of our Class A common stock.

The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. On conversion of the Convertible Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, any

sales in the public market of our Class A common stock issuable on such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our Class A common stock, any of which could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.

We have in the past and may continue to engage in exchanges, repurchases, or induced conversions of the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes that participate in any of these exchanges, repurchases, or induced conversions may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock or sell shares of our Class A common stock in the open market to hedge their exposure in connection with these transactions. These activities could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our Class A common stock or the Convertible Notes, or dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be affected by short sales of our Class A common stock or the entry into or unwind of economically equivalent derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock by investors that do not participate in the exchange transactions and by the hedging activity of the counterparties to our Capped Call Transactions or their respective affiliates. Furthermore, repurchases of the Convertible Notes reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes.

We may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would diminish our ability to make payments on the Convertible Notes when due. Our ability to repay our debt depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control.

We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our current and future debt instruments. We are not restricted under the terms of the Indentures governing the Convertible Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, repurchasing our stock, making investments, paying dividends, recapitalizing our debt, or taking a number of other actions that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Convertible Notes when due.

Our ability to pay our debt when due or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, depends on our financial condition at such time, the condition of capital markets, and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control.

The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

The Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder. In the event the conditions for optional conversion of the 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, or 2030 Notes by holders are met before the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 1, 2025, May 1, 2026, February 1, 2027, December 1, 2027, or May 1, 2030, respectively, holders of the applicable Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we may settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital and may seriously harm our business.

We entered into certain hedging positions that may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and the volatility and value of our Class A common stock.

In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into certain hedging positions with certain financial institutions. These hedging positions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution of our Class A common stock on any conversion of the Convertible Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap.

The counterparties to these hedging positions or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so

during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes or following any repurchase of Convertible Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock or the Convertible Notes. In addition, if any such hedging positions fail to become effective, the counterparties to these hedging positions or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.

Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as our Indentures, could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult or more expensive, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:

•our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital structure. As a result of this structure, Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy control all stockholder decisions, and Mr. Spiegel alone may exercise voting control over our outstanding capital stock. This includes the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change-of-control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class A common stock dividend, and any future issuances of Class A common stock dividends, could have the effect of prolonging the influence of Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy on the company;

•our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;

•our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect directors; and

•our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.

Any provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.

Furthermore, certain provisions in the Indentures governing the Convertible Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the Indentures require us, at the holders’ election, to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash on the occurrence of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its Convertible Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Convertible Notes or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a third party to acquire us. The Indentures also prohibit us from engaging in a merger or acquisition unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Convertible Notes and the Indentures. These and other provisions in the Indentures could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the Convertible Notes or our stockholders.

Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.

If our existing stockholders, including employees and service providers who obtain equity, sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. As a result of our capital structure, holders who are not required to file reports under Section 16 of the Exchange Act are not obligated to disclose changes in ownership of our Class A common stock, so there can be no assurance that you, or we, will be notified of any such changes. All of our outstanding shares are eligible for sale in the public market, except shares held by directors, executive officers, and other affiliates that are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Our employees, other service providers, and directors are subject to our quarterly trading window closures. In addition, we have reserved shares for issuance under our equity incentive plans. We may also issue shares of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into our Class A common stock from time to time in

connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, or otherwise. When these shares are issued and subsequently sold, it would be dilutive to existing stockholders and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.

If securities or industry analysts either do not publish research about us, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the trading price or trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.

The trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts initiate research with an unfavorable rating or downgrade our Class A common stock, provide a more favorable recommendation about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume to decline. Since we provide only limited financial guidance, this may increase the probability that our financial results are perceived as not in line with analysts’ expectations, and could cause volatility to our Class A common stock price.

We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the market price of our Class A common stock increases. In addition, our Credit Facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends.

If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be seriously harmed.

We are required to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, perform system and process evaluation and testing of those internal controls to allow management to report on their effectiveness, report any material weaknesses in such internal controls, and obtain an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of such internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all of which is time-consuming, costly, and complicated. If we are unable to comply with these requirements in a timely manner, if we assert that our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective, if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion or expresses a qualified or adverse opinion about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the NYSE, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.

The requirements of being a public company have and may continue to strain our resources, result in more litigation, and divert management’s attention.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Complying with these rules and regulations have caused and will continue to cause us to incur additional legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, be time-consuming or costly, and continue to increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results, and that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a public company we are required to publicly disclose additional details about our business and financial condition information, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors, regulators, and other third parties. If those claims are successful, our business could be harmed. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources needed to resolve them could divert our management’s resources and harm our business.

Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:

•any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;

•any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;

•any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws; and

•any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.

This provision would not apply to actions brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act claims, which means both courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.

These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring an action in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, federal courts have been split on the issue, and a stockholder may seek to bring an action in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such an instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of our exclusive forum provisions, which may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Snap Inc.


### Opinion on the Financial Statements


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Snap Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


### Critical Audit Matter


The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Description of the Matter As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generates substantially all of its revenues by offering various advertising products on Snapchat. The substantial majority of such advertising revenues is generated based upon contractual agreements with customers that are either based on the number of advertising impressions delivered or on a fixed fee basis for advertisements delivered over a period of time. Revenues related to agreements based on the number of advertising impressions delivered are recognized when the advertisements are served while fixed fee agreements are recognized ratably over the service period. The Company’s advertising revenue recognition process utilizes proprietary systems for the initiation, processing, and recording of transactions which comprise a high volume of individually low monetary value transactions. This process is dependent on the effective design and operation of systems, data sources, and controls that required significant audit effort.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit With the support of our information technology professionals, we identified and tested the relevant systems used for the determination of initiation, processing, recording, and billing of revenue, which included processes and controls related to access to the relevant systems and data, changes to the relevant systems and interfaces, and configuration of the relevant systems. To test the Company’s recognition of advertising revenue, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data within the Company’s billing systems by agreeing amounts recognized to contractual terms and conditions, and testing revenue recognized to accounts receivable and cash receipts. Additionally, we examined standard customer online terms and conditions to understand the distinct performance obligations and tested the timing of revenue recognition.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Snap Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Snap Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Snap Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Snap Inc. is a technology company.

Snap Inc. (“we,” “our,” or “us”), a Delaware corporation, is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Our flagship product, Snapchat, is a visual messaging application that was created to help people communicate through short videos and images called “Snaps.”


### Basis of Presentation


Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snap Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on December 31. Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior periods to conform to the current year’s presentation. None of these reclassifications had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.


### Use of Estimates


The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Management’s estimates are based on historical information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Key estimates relate primarily to determining the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, evaluation of contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and the fair value of strategic investments. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates our estimates compared to historical experience and trends, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.


### Concentrations of Business Risk


We currently use both Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for our hosting requirements. A disruption or loss of service from one or both of these partners could seriously harm our ability to operate. Although we believe there are other qualified providers that can provide these services, a transition to a new provider could create a significant disruption to our business and negatively impact our consolidated financial statements.


### Concentrations of Credit Risk


Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. We maintain cash deposits, cash equivalent balances, and marketable securities with several financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents may be withdrawn or redeemed on demand. We believe that the financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances. We also maintain investments in U.S. government debt and agency securities, publicly traded equity securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and commercial paper that carry high credit ratings and accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances.

We extend credit to our customers based on an evaluation of their ability to pay amounts due under contractual arrangement and generally do not obtain or require collateral.


### Revenue Recognition


Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 2 for additional information.


### Cost of Revenue


Cost of revenue includes payments for infrastructure, content and developer partner costs, and advertiser partner and other costs. Infrastructure costs primarily consist of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products, which include expenses related to storage, computing, and bandwidth. Content and developer partner costs primarily consist of fees paid to our content creators and publisher partners who share content on our platform through revenue sharing arrangements. Under these arrangements, we pay a portion of the fees we receive from advertisers for Snap Ads that are displayed within partner content on Snapchat. Advertising partner and other costs primarily consist of payments to third-party partners for fulfillment services, credit card and other transaction processing fees, and other expenses directly related to providing our services.

Cost of revenue includes personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in the delivery of our services. Cost of revenue also includes facilities and other supporting overhead costs, including depreciation and amortization, and inventory costs.


### Advertising


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and recorded within sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, advertising costs were $57.7 million, $24.9 million, and $42.7 million, respectively.


### Capital Structure


We have three classes of authorized common stock – Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock. Class A common stockholders have no voting rights, Class B common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share, and Class C common stockholders are entitled to ten votes per share. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Shares of our Class C common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class B common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class B common stock upon transfer.

Future Stock Split to be Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend

In July 2022, our board of directors determined that it was advisable and in our best interest to approve a stock split to be effected in the form of a special dividend of one share of Class A common stock on each outstanding share of our common stock at a future date (the “Future Stock Split”). In connection with the Future Stock Split, we entered into certain agreements (the “Co-Founder Agreements”) with Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, our co-founders, and certain of their respective affiliates requiring them, among other things, to convert shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock into Class A common stock under certain circumstances. In May 2024, the conditions for the declaration of such dividends were modified and the Co-Founder Agreements were amended to reflect such modifications. As modified, the Future Stock Split will not be declared and paid until the first business day following the date on which (i) the average of the volume weighted average price (the “VWAP”) per share of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $40 per share for 90 consecutive trading days (the “90-Day VWAP”) and (ii) the ratio of the 90-Day VWAP to $8.70 equals or exceeds the ratio of the average closing price of the S&P 500 Total Return index for the same 90 trading days for which the 90-Day VWAP was calculated to 8,862.85. If this does not occur by July 21, 2032, the Future Stock Split will not be declared and paid, and the Co-Founder Agreements will terminate.

No adjustments have been made to share or per share amounts for Class A common stock in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the effects of the Future Stock Split as these triggering conditions have not been met.


### Stock-based Compensation


We measure and recognize compensation expense for stock-based payment awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) granted to employees, directors, and advisors, based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock-based compensation for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the period during which services are provided in exchange for the award. The grant date fair value of RSUs and RSAs is estimated based on the fair value of our underlying common stock.

RSUs and RSAs vest on the satisfaction of a service-based condition. The service condition for RSUs and RSAs is generally satisfied in equal monthly or quarterly installments over three or four years. For these awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized for all periods presented is based on awards that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures. We estimate the forfeiture rate using historical forfeitures of equity awards and other expected changes in facts and circumstances, if any. A modification of the terms of a stock-based award is treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award with total compensation cost equal to the grant-date fair value of the original award plus the incremental value of the modification to the award.

The total recognized tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense for all periods presented was immaterial as we have established valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The majority of the future tax benefits that arise on settlement of RSUs, RSAs and stock options are in jurisdictions for which our net deferred tax assets have a full valuation allowance.


### Income Taxes


We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.

In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Based on the level of historical losses, we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in our consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. We recognize interest and penalties associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on our consolidated balance sheets.

Currency Translation and Remeasurement

The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at the average exchange rates during the period. Equity transactions and other non-monetary assets are remeasured using historical exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations. For those foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.


### Restricted Cash


Restricted cash primarily includes cash and cash equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or use in our operations. Restricted cash balances are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.


### Marketable Securities


We hold investments in marketable securities consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and publicly traded equity securities. We

classify marketable investments in debt securities as available-for-sale investments in our current assets because they represent investments available for current operations.

Our available-for-sale investments in debt securities are carried at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses, with any allowance for credit losses recognized as a charge in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. We did not record any credit losses on our available-for-sale debt securities in any of the periods presented. We determine gains or losses on the sale or maturities of marketable securities using the specific identification method and these gains or losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.

Publicly traded equity securities are carried at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.


### Strategic Investments


We hold strategic investments primarily in privately held companies, consisting primarily of equity securities without readily determinable fair values, and to a lesser extent, debt securities. We adjust the carrying value of these equity securities to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or upon impairment. All strategic investments are reviewed periodically for impairment. Any adjustments to carrying value of these investments are recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Strategic investments are included within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

When we exercise significant influence over, but do not control the investee, such strategic investments are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our share of the results of the investments within other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.


### Fair Value Measurements


Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Additionally, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less any allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. To determine the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluation and historical experience. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for doubtful accounts was immaterial.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three years for computer hardware, software, and equipment, five years for furniture, and over the shorter of lease term or useful life of the assets for leasehold improvements. Buildings are generally depreciated over a useful life ranging from 20 to 45 years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.


### Leases


We have non-cancelable lease agreements, primarily for offices, that are recorded as operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and do not record leases with an initial term of twelve months or less in our consolidated balance sheets. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or

terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. Certain agreements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.


### Software Development Costs


Software development costs include costs to develop software to be used to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.


### Segments


Our CEO is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). Our CEO evaluates performance and makes operating decisions about allocating resources based on financial data presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue disaggregated by geographic region. Because our CODM evaluates financial performance on a consolidated basis, we have determined that we have a single reportable segment composed of the consolidated financial results of Snap Inc.


### Business Combinations


We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire from the date of acquisition. We determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the respective date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. At the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.

When we issue payments or grants of equity to selling stockholders in connection with an acquisition, we evaluate whether the payments or awards are compensatory. This evaluation includes whether cash payments or stock award vesting is contingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for the cash to be paid or stock awards to vest, the award is treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and is recognized as compensation expense.

Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred, and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.


### Goodwill


Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. For all periods presented, we had a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. There were no impairment charges in any of the periods presented.


### Intangible Assets


Intangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We determine the appropriate useful life of our intangible assets by measuring the expected cash flows of acquired assets. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are generally as follows:


#### Table 7: 7
| label | col_6 |
| --- | --- |
| Intangible Asset | Estimated Useful Life |
| Domain names | 5 years |
| Trademarks | 3 years |
| Acquired developed technology | 3 to 7 years |
| Customer relationships | 2 to 8 years |
| Patents | 4 to 14 years |




### Impairment of Long-Lived Assets


We evaluate recoverability of our property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, when events or changes indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events and changes in circumstances considered in determining whether the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in asset use, and significant negative industry or economic trends and changes in our business strategy. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated. If impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets’ carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.


### Legal Contingencies


For legal contingencies, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal fees and expenses are expensed as incurred. Note 8 provides additional information regarding our legal contingencies.


### Recent Accounting Pronouncements


In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2024-04, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments, which clarifies the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2025. The guidance is applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires public entities to provide a disclosure within the financial statement footnotes showing the disaggregation of certain expenses included in relevant expense captions on the consolidated income statement, with a qualitative description of the amounts that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. The guidance also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027.

The guidance also requires disaggregating the annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds received, by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, with separate presentation of individual jurisdictions that

meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by this standard and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280 on an interim and annual basis, including new requirements to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within the reported measure(s) of a segment’s profit or loss, the amount and composition of any other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of a segment’s profit or loss to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, applied retrospectively with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-07. Refer to Note 19 of these consolidated financial statements.

2. Revenue

We determine revenue recognition by first identifying the contract or contracts with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We determine collectability by performing ongoing credit evaluations and monitoring customer accounts receivable balances. Sales tax, including value added tax, is excluded from reported revenue.

We generate substantially all of our revenues by offering various advertising products on Snapchat, which include Snap Ads and AR Ads, referred to as advertising revenue. AR Ads include Sponsored Lenses, which allow users to interact with an advertiser’s brand by enabling branded augmented reality experiences.

The substantial majority of advertising revenue is generated from the display of advertisements on Snapchat through contractual agreements that are either based on the number of advertising impressions delivered or on a fixed fee basis over a period of time. Revenue related to agreements based on the number of impressions delivered is recognized when the advertisement is served. Revenue related to fixed fee arrangements is recognized ratably over the service period, typically less than 30 days in duration, and such arrangements do not contain minimum impression guarantees.

In arrangements where another party is involved in providing specified services to a customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal or agent. In this evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. For the periods presented, revenue for arrangements where we are the agent was not material.

We also generate revenue from subscriptions and sales of hardware products. Sales of hardware products are reported net of allowances for returns. For the periods presented, all such revenue was not material.

The following table represents our revenue disaggregated by geographic region based on the billing address of the customer:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) | 2022 - (in thousands) |

| **Total revenue** | **$5,361,398** | **$4,606,115** | **$4,601,847** |



(1)North America includes Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America.

(2)United States revenue was $3.1 billion, $2.9 billion, and $3.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

(3)Europe includes Russia and Turkey. Effective March 2022, we halted advertising sales to Russian and Belarusian entities.

3. Net Loss per Share

We compute net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock. We have three classes of authorized common stock for which voting rights differ by class.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to each class of stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of stock outstanding during the period, adjusted for RSAs for which the risk of forfeiture has not yet lapsed.

For the calculation of diluted net loss per share, net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for basic net loss per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plans. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding. We use the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the convertible senior notes due in 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, and 2030 (collectively, the “Convertible Notes”) on diluted net loss per share. The Convertible Notes would have a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of Class A common stock for a given period exceeds the respective conversion price of the Convertible Notes. For the periods presented, our potentially dilutive shares relating to stock options, RSUs, RSAs, and Convertible Notes were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect of including these shares in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.

The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net loss per share computations for our common stock are calculated as follows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

4. Stockholders’ Equity


### Common Stock


As of December 31, 2024, we are authorized to issue 3,000,000,000 shares of Class A non-voting common stock, 700,000,000 shares of Class B voting common stock, and 260,887,848 shares of Class C voting common stock, each with a par value of $0.00001 per share. Class A common stockholders have no voting rights, Class B common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share, and Class C common stockholders are entitled to ten votes per share. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Shares of our Class C common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class B common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class B common stock upon transfer. Any dividends paid to the holders of the Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock will be paid on a pro rata basis. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not declare any dividends. On a liquidation event, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, any distribution to common stockholders is made on a pro rata basis to the holders of the Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock.

As of December 31, 2024, there were 1,483,717,717 shares issued and 1,436,495,296 shares outstanding of Class A common stock, and 22,523,290 shares and 231,626,943 shares issued and outstanding of Class B common stock and Class C common stock, respectively.


### Stock-based Compensation Plans


We maintain one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). In January 2017, our board of directors adopted the 2017 Plan, and in February 2017, our stockholders approved the 2017 Plan, effective on March 1, 2017. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees,

including employees of any parent or subsidiary, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSUs, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other forms of stock awards to employees, directors, and consultants, including employees and consultants of our affiliates. The maximum term for stock options granted under the 2017 Plan may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The 2017 Plan will terminate ten years from the date our board of directors approved the plan, unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors.

The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan will increase automatically on January 1st of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2018 through January 1, 2027, by the lesser of (i) 5.0% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December 31st of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (ii) a number determined by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2024, there were 152,488,503 shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.

2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In January 2017, our board of directors adopted the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2017 ESPP”). Our stockholders approved the 2017 ESPP in February 2017. The 2017 ESPP became effective in connection with the IPO. A total of 16,484,690 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2017 ESPP. No shares of our Class A common stock have been issued or offered under the 2017 ESPP. The number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase on January 1st of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2018 through January 1, 2027, by the lesser of (i) 1.0% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the last day of the calendar month before the date of the automatic increase, and (ii) 15,000,000 shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii). As of December 31, 2024, there were 16,484,690 shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 ESPP.

Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Awards

The following table summarizes the RSU and RSA activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:

(1)The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock option awards and the closing market price of our Class A common stock as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

There were no stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $8.41 per share as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

As of December 31, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the 2017 Stock Plan.

There were no stock options that vested for the year ended December 31, 2024. The total grant date fair value of stock options that vested for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $1.4 million, $12.3 million, and $5.9 million, respectively.

### Stock Repurchases


In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We did not repurchase any shares under this program in the fourth quarter of 2024. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, the remaining availability under the stock repurchase authorization was $500.0 million.

In October 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. The program was completed in the second quarter of 2024, during which we repurchased, and subsequently retired, 46.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $500.5 million, representing the entire amount approved by our board of directors and including costs associated with the repurchases.

In October 2022, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. The program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, during which we repurchased, and subsequently retired, 53.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $500.5 million, representing the entire amount approved by our board of directors and including costs associated with the repurchases.

In July 2022, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. The program was completed in the third quarter of 2022, during which we repurchased 51.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $500.5 million, representing the entire amount approved by our board of directors and including costs associated with the repurchases. These shares are recorded as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets and remain available for re-issuance.

5. Business Acquisitions

2023 Acquisitions

In 2023, the aggregate purchase consideration for business acquisitions was $73.1 million, which primarily consisted of $56.3 million in cash and $12.6 million recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Of the aggregate purchase consideration, $42.8 million was allocated to goodwill and the remainder primarily to identifiable intangible assets. The acquired assets are expected to enhance our existing platform, technology, and workforce. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing platform expected to be realized from the business acquisitions and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill and intangible assets are not deductible for tax purposes.

2022 Acquisitions

In 2022, we completed acquisitions to enhance our existing platform, technology, and workforce. The aggregate purchase consideration was $120.5 million, which included $17.7 million in cash, $44.0 million in shares of our Class A common stock, and $58.8 million recorded in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Of the aggregate purchase consideration, $69.3 million was allocated to goodwill and the remainder primarily to identifiable intangible assets. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing platform expected to be realized from the business acquisitions and assembled workforce. Of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets, $101.7 million is deductible for tax purposes.

Additional Information on 2023 and 2022 Acquisitions

The operating results of the above acquisitions were included in the results of our operations from the acquisition date and were not material to our consolidated revenue or consolidated operating loss. In addition, unaudited pro forma results of operations assuming the above acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of each period are not provided because the historical operating results of the acquired entities were not material and pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results for the periods presented.

### Convertible Notes


2030 Notes

In May 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement with certain counterparties for the sale of an aggregate of $750.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2030 Notes consisted of a $650.0 million initial placement and an over-allotment option that provided the initial purchasers of the 2030 Notes with the option to purchase an additional $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes, which was fully exercised. The 2030 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated May 13, 2024. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes were $671.5 million, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (“2030 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2030 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears beginning on November 1, 2024 at a rate of 0.50% per year. The 2030 Notes mature on May 1, 2030 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2030 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 45.0846 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2030 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.18 per share of our Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain events as described in the indenture governing the 2030 Notes.

We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2030 Notes, at our option, on or after May 5, 2027 if (i) the 2030 Notes are “freely tradable” (as defined in the applicable indenture) and any accrued and unpaid additional interest has been paid as of the date we send the related redemption notice and (ii) the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

Holders of the 2030 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2030 Notes at their option prior to February 1, 2030, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, only under the following circumstances:

•if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2030 Notes on each such trading day;

•during the five consecutive business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2030 Notes for each day of that ten consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the 2030 Notes on such trading day;

•on a notice of redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, in which case we may be required to increase the conversion rate for the 2030 Notes so surrendered for conversion in connection with such redemption notice; or

•on the occurrence of specified corporate events.

On or after February 1, 2030, the 2030 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.

Holders of the 2030 Notes who convert the 2030 Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2030 Notes, or in connection with a redemption are entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the 2030 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2030 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 2030 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

We accounted for the issuance of the 2030 Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives.

2028 Notes

In February 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of an aggregate of $1.50 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes were $1.31 billion, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (the “2028 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2028 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears beginning on September 1, 2022 at a rate of 0.125% per year. The 2028 Notes mature on March 1, 2028 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2028 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 17.7494 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2028 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $56.34 per share of our Class A common stock. Holders of the 2028 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2028 Notes at their option prior to December 1, 2027, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes. On or after December 1, 2027, the 2028 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2028 Notes, at our option, on or after March 5, 2025 based on certain circumstances.

2027 Notes

In April 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of an aggregate of $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes were $1.05 billion, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (the “2027 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2027 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations which do not bear regular interest and for which the principal balance will not accrete. The 2027 Notes will mature on May 1, 2027 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 11.2042 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $89.25 per share of our Class A common stock. Holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2027 Notes at their option prior to February 1, 2027, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. On or after February 1, 2027, the 2027 Notes are convertible at any

time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. We may redeem for cash all or portions of the 2027 Notes, at our option, on or after May 5, 2024 based on certain circumstances.

2026 Notes

In August 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of an aggregate of $1.265 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes were $1.15 billion, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (the “2026 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2026 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears beginning on February 1, 2020 at a rate of 0.75% per year. The 2026 Notes mature on August 1, 2026 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with the terms prior to such date.

The 2026 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 43.8481 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2026 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.81 per share of our Class A common stock. Holders of the 2026 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2026 Notes at their option prior to May 1, 2016, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes. On or after May 1, 2026, the 2026 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. We may redeem for cash all or portions of the 2026 Notes, at our option, on or after August 6, 2023 based on certain circumstances.

2025 Notes

In April 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of an aggregate of $1.0 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes were $888.6 million, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (the “2025 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2025 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears beginning on November 1, 2020 at a rate of 0.25% per year. The 2025 Notes mature on May 1, 2025 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2025 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 46.1233 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $21.68 per share of our Class A common stock. Holders of the 2025 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2025 Notes at their option prior to February 1, 2025, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2025 Notes. On or after February 1, 2025, the 2025 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. We may redeem for cash all or portions of the 2025 Notes, at our option, on or after May 6, 2023 based on certain circumstances.


#### Note Repurchases


In February 2024, we entered into various privately negotiated repurchase transactions with certain holders of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase $100.0 million in aggregate principal of the 2025 Notes and $351.2 million in aggregate principal of the 2026 Notes for a cash repurchase price of $440.7 million, including associated costs. The February 2024 repurchase transactions resulted in an $8.8 million gain on extinguishment in the first quarter of 2024.

In May 2024, we entered into various privately negotiated repurchase transactions (collectively with the February 2024 repurchase transactions, the “Note Repurchases”) with certain holders of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase $147.9 million in aggregate principal of the 2025 Notes and approximately $237.5 million in aggregate principal of the 2026 Notes for a cash repurchase price of approximately $418.3 million, including associated costs. The May 2024 repurchase transactions were accounted for as both a debt modification and a partial debt

extinguishment, resulting in a $15.5 million loss on extinguishment during the second quarter of 2024 and $20.9 million in capitalized debt issuance costs amortized over the term of the 2030 Notes. The capitalized debt issuance costs are primarily related to repurchase premiums and debt issuance costs carried over from the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes.

Gains and losses on extinguishment are included within other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and included within Other as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Convertible Notes consisted of the following:

| 2030 Notes | 750,000 | ( 27,447 ) | 722,553 | — | — | — |
| **Total** | **$3,685,994** | **$(42,065)** | **$3,643,929** | **$3,772,587** | **$(23,187)** | **$3,749,400** |



Each of the notes in the table above rank equally with each other. The effective interest rates for the 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2030 Notes range between 0.19% and 1.21%. As of December 31, 2024, the debt issuance costs on the 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, and 2030 Notes will be amortized over the remaining period of approximately 0.3 years, 1.6 years, 2.3 years, 3.2 years, and 5.3 years, respectively.

The following table summarizes interest expense related to the Convertible Notes:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) | 2022 - (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Contractual interest expense | $7,334 | $8,874 | $8,655 |
| Amortization of debt issuance costs | 8,906 | 6,880 | 6,543 |
| **Total interest expense** | **$16,240** | **$15,754** | **$15,198** |



As of December 31, 2024, the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes did not exceed the principal amount. The sale price for conversion was not satisfied as of December 31, 2024 for the Convertible Notes, and as a result, the Convertible Notes will not be eligible for optional conversion during the first quarter of 2025, other than the 2025 Notes, which are eligible for optional conversion on or after February 1, 2025. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire them periodically.


#### Capped Call Transactions


In connection with the pricing of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2028 Notes, and the 2030 Notes, we entered into the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, the 2026 Capped Call Transactions, the 2027 Capped Call Transactions, the 2028 Capped Call Transactions, and the 2030 Capped Call Transactions (collectively, the “Capped Call Transactions”), respectively, with certain counterparties at a net cost of $100.0 million, $102.1 million, $86.8 million, $177.0 million, and $68.9 million respectively. The cap price of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, the 2026 Capped Call Transactions, the 2027 Capped Call Transactions, the 2028 Capped Call Transactions, and the 2030 Capped Call Transactions is initially $32.12, $32.58, $121.02, $93.90, and $33.48 per share of our Class A common stock, respectively. All are subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Conditions that cause adjustments to the initial strike price of the Capped Call Transactions mirror conditions that result in corresponding adjustments for the Convertible Notes.

The Capped Call Transactions are intended to reduce potential dilution to holders of our Class A common stock beyond the conversion prices up to the cap prices on any conversion of the Convertible Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction of our additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets. The Capped Call Transactions will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.

In May 2024, we entered into agreements to terminate all of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, which resulted in $62.7 million recorded within additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2024, the remaining Capped Call Transactions were out-of-the-money.


### Credit Facility


In May 2022, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with certain lenders that allows us to borrow up to $1.05 billion to fund working capital and general corporate-purpose expenditures. Loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) a term secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 0.75% or the base rate, if selected by us, for loans made in U.S. dollars, (ii) the Sterling overnight index average plus 0.7826% for loans made in Sterling, or (iii) foreign indices as stated in the credit agreement plus 0.75% for loans made in other permitted foreign currencies. The base rate is defined as the greatest of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (ii) the greater of the (a) federal funds rate and (b) the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the applicable SOFR for a period of one month (but not less than zero) plus 1.00. The Credit Facility also contains an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. As of December 31, 2024, we had $80.7 million in the form of outstanding standby letters of credit, with no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.

8. Commitments and Contingencies


### Commitments


We have non-cancelable contractual agreements primarily related to the hosting of our data processing, storage, and other computing services, as well as lease, content and developer partner, and other commitments. For additional discussion on leases, see Note 9 of these consolidated financial statements.

Our non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:


#### Table: Non-Cancelable Commitments
| label | (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: |
| Year ending December 31, |  |
| 2025 | $1,458,829 |
| 2026 | 1,835,591 |
| 2027 | 1,051,169 |
| 2028 | 87,229 |
| 2029 | 84,288 |
| Thereafter | 423,135 |
| **Total non-cancelable contractual commitments** | **$4,940,241** |




### Contingencies


We record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We also disclose material contingencies when we believe a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Accounting for contingencies requires us to use judgment related to both the likelihood of a loss and the estimate of the amount or range of loss. Many legal and tax contingencies can take years to be resolved.


#### Pending Matters


In November 2021, we, and certain of our officers and directors, were named as defendants in a securities class- action lawsuit purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our Class A common stock, alleging that we and certain of our officers made false or misleading statements and omissions concerning the impact that Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework would have on our business. We believe we have meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously. Based on the proceedings in this case, the outcome of this matter remains uncertain.

The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for a particular period. For the pending matter described above, it is not possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.

We are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including certain patent, trademark, privacy, regulatory, and employment matters. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, we do not believe that the final disposition of any of our other pending matters will seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.


### Indemnifications


In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, investors, directors, officers, employees, and other parties with respect to certain matters. Indemnification may include losses from our breach of such agreements, services we provide, or third-party intellectual property infringement claims. These indemnifications may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future indemnification payments may not be subject to a cap. We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnifications as of December 31, 2024. We believe the fair value of these liabilities is immaterial and accordingly have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2024.

9. Leases

We have non-cancelable lease agreements for certain of our offices with original lease terms expiring between 2025 and 2042. Total operating lease costs were $101.0 million, $101.0 million, and $109.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

The weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) and discount rate related to our operating leases were as follows:


#### Table: As of December 31,
| label | 2024 | 2023 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Weighted-average remaining lease term | 9.3 | 10.0 |
| Weighted-average discount rate | 6.1% | 6.1% |



The maturities of our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:


#### Table: Operating Leases
| label | (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: |
| Year ending December 31, |  |
| 2025 | $60,937 |
| 2026 | 93,051 |
| 2027 | 86,587 |
| 2028 | 85,428 |
| 2029 | 82,431 |
| Thereafter | 410,487 |
| **Total lease payments** | **818,921** |
| Less: imputed interest | ( 218,954 ) |
| Present value of lease liabilities | $599,967 |



As of December 31, 2024, we had additional operating leases that have not yet commenced for facilities with lease obligations of $19.7 million. These operating leases will commence starting in 2025 with lease terms of approximately 10 years to 11 years.

Cash payments included in the measurement of our operating lease liabilities, net of lease incentives received, were $101.4 million, $89.8 million, and $92.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Lease liabilities arising from obtaining operating lease right-of-use assets were $71.0 million, $220.2 million, and $147.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

10. Strategic Investments

We hold strategic investments primarily in privately held companies, consisting primarily of equity securities without readily determinable fair values, and to a lesser extent, debt securities. These strategic investments are primarily recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The estimation of fair value for these privately held strategic investments requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, such as the issuance of new equity by the company, and as a result, we deem these assets as Level 3 financial instruments within the fair value measurement framework.

The following table summarizes our strategic investments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:


#### Table: As of December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Initial cost | $106,052 | $106,368 |

Gains and losses on all strategic investments are included within other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and included as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Strategic investments are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

11. Fair Value Measurements

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified into the following categories:

•Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

•Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.

We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market-based inputs to determine their fair value.

The following tables set forth our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding publicly traded equity securities, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Gross unrealized losses on marketable debt securities were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we considered any decreases in fair value on our marketable debt securities to be driven by factors other than credit risk, including market risk. As of December 31, 2024, $1.1 billion of our total $2.3 billion in marketable debt securities have contractual maturities between one and five years. All other marketable debt securities have contractual maturities less than one year.

We hold investments in publicly traded companies with an aggregate carrying value of $12.4 million and $13.6 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, recorded as marketable securities. We classify these publicly traded equity securities within Level 1 because we use quoted market prices to determine their fair value. Gains and losses recognized during the periods presented, which are included within other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations, were as follows:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) | 2022 - (in thousands) |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |

We carry the Convertible Notes at face value less the unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets and present the fair value for disclosure purposes only. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2028 Notes, and the 2030 Notes was $35.5 million, $242.7 million, $998.5 million, $1,226.6 million, and $635.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2028 Notes was $300.9 million, $893.2 million, $921.5 million, and $1,181.7 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes, which are classified as Level 2 financial instruments, was determined based on the estimated or actual bid prices of the Convertible Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last business day of the period.

On December 20, 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, are currently proposing or have enacted legislation to implement core elements of the Pillar Two proposal. On February 1, 2023, the FASB indicated that they believe the minimum tax imposed under Pillar Two is an alternative minimum tax, and, accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the minimum tax would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated future effects of the minimum tax but would be recognized in the period incurred. We are closely monitoring developments and evaluating their potential impact. Enactments effective in 2024 did not have a significant impact on our

2024 financial results, nor do we anticipate a significant impact on our financial results during the transition period due to safe harbor relief.

As of December 31, 2024, we had an immaterial amount of unremitted earnings related to certain foreign subsidiaries. We intend to continue to reinvest these foreign earnings indefinitely and do not expect to incur any significant taxes related to such amounts.

As of December 31, 2024, we had accumulated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $6.1 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. During 2024, we fully utilized all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards generated before January 1, 2018, which were subject to a 20-year carryforward period and no taxable income limitation. The remaining $6.1 billion can be carried forward indefinitely but is subject to an 80% taxable income limitation. Certain significant state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2024, we had $4.7 billion of U.K. net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely; however, use of such carryforwards in a given year is generally limited to 50% of such year’s taxable income. As of December 31, 2024, we had accumulated $214.0 million of Singapore net operating loss carryforwards, which can be carried forward indefinitely and are not subject to any taxable income limitation. As of December 31, 2024, we had accumulated U.S. federal and state research tax credits of $916.5 million and $523.7 million, respectively. The U.S. federal research tax credits will begin to expire in 2032. The U.S. state research tax credits do not expire.

Beginning January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the option to currently deduct research and development expenditures in the period incurred and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenditures over five or fifteen years, as applicable, pursuant to Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code. In prior years, this tax law change did not result in any U.S. federal tax liability due to the availability of pre-2018 federal net operating loss carryforwards. However, as these pre-2018 carryforwards were fully utilized in 2024, the application of the 80% taxable income limitation on remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards resulted in incremental U.S. federal tax liability and expense for the year ended December 31, 2024. We continue to incur incremental state tax liability and expense due to limitations on the use of existing state net operating loss carryforwards.

We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We had valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets of $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2024, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a net increase in our deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations.


### Uncertain Tax Positions


The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) | 2022 - (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits | $513,404 | $510,669 | $469,573 |
| Additions for current year tax positions | 49,536 | 46,188 | 47,366 |
| Additions for prior year tax positions | 1,163 | 10,171 | 115 |
| Reductions for prior year tax positions | ( 622 ) | ( 16,736 ) | ( 3,569 ) |
| Changes due to lapse of statute of limitations | ( 99 ) | ( 31,786 ) | ( 1,887 ) |
| Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities | — | ( 4,927 ) | — |
| Changes due to foreign currency translation adjustments | ( 574 ) | ( 175 ) | ( 929 ) |
| Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) | 562,808 | 513,404 | 510,669 |
| Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits | 1,918 | 967 | 385 |
| Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties) | $564,726 | $514,371 | $511,054 |



Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefit was recorded as a reduction in our gross deferred tax assets, offset by a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. We have net unrecognized tax benefits of $35.8 million and $27.3 million included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which, if recognized, would result in a tax benefit.

Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense recorded related to uncertain tax positions was not material.

The income taxes we pay are subject to potential review by taxing jurisdictions globally. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax position is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We believe that our estimate has adequately provided for these matters. However, our future results may include adjustments to estimates in the period the audits are resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate.

The material tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States for tax years ending on or after 2012, and the United Kingdom for tax years ending on or after 2020. We are currently under examination by the U.K. tax authorities for tax years 2020 through 2022, and also in various other jurisdictions covering multiple tax years.

Depreciation on property and equipment was $98.0 million, $87.3 million, and $69.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Noncash property and equipment additions in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities were $29.3 million, $44.5 million, and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

15. Balance Sheet Components

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following:

| Other | 140,630 | 136,381 |
| **Total accrued expenses and other current liabilities** | **$1,009,254** | **$805,836** |



(1)We expect a substantial majority of our deferred revenue to be realized in less than one year.

16. Employee Benefit Plans

We have a defined contribution savings plan for U.S.-based employees under the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”). The 401(k) Plan is available for all full-time employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible employees may contribute up to 100% of their eligible compensation, but are limited to the maximum annual dollar amount allowable under the Code. We match 100% of each participant’s contribution up to a maximum of 3% of the participant’s eligible compensation paid during the period, and also match 50% of each participant’s contribution between 3% and 5% of the participant’s eligible compensation paid during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized expense of $29.6 million, $34.0 million, and $33.6 million, respectively, related to matching contributions.

17. Related Party Transactions

In November 2020, we entered into a ground sublease with an entity that is controlled by our CEO that allows us to build and operate a hangar to support our aviation program. This entity subleases the ground to us for $0 and in exchange may utilize a specified percentage of the hangar space. If the entity needs additional space within the hangar, it will pay rent to Snap at a fair market value rate determined at the time this arrangement was entered into. Any space utilized by this entity will be space that is not required for Snap’s aviation program. Subject to certain limited exceptions, neither party may terminate this sublease for at least six years. After this period, Snap or this entity may terminate the lease at any time on 24 months’ prior written notice. Upon termination of the sublease, this entity will purchase the hangar from Snap at its fair market value on the termination date.

The value of these arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented or for the term of the agreement.

18. Restructuring

2024 Restructuring

In the first quarter of 2024, we announced a plan to reduce hierarchy and concentrate our team members in major hub locations to support in-person collaboration, resulting in the reduction of our global headcount by approximately 10%. We completed the 2024 restructuring in the second quarter of 2024.

The following table summarizes the 2024 restructuring charges included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024:


#### Table 37: 7

(2)Other primarily includes intangible asset amortization and depreciation expense.


### AR Enterprise Strategic Review


In the third quarter of 2023, we initiated the wind down of our AR Enterprise business, which included a reduction of our global employee headcount by approximately 3%. We substantially completed the program in the fourth quarter of 2023.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized pre-tax restructuring charges of $40.8 million, primarily recorded in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations, and an income tax benefit of $5.7 million. The pre-tax restructuring charges primarily include cash severance, stock-based compensation expense, and charges related to the revision of the useful lives and disposal of certain acquired intangible assets.

Strategic Reprioritization

In the third quarter of 2022, we initiated a strategic reprioritization plan, which included a reduction of our global employee headcount by approximately 20%. We substantially completed the reprioritization plan in the fourth quarter of 2022.

The following table summarizes the restructuring charges (benefits) in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022:

19. Segments and Geographic Information

Our CEO is our CODM. Our CODM evaluates performance and makes operating decisions about allocating resources based on financial data presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue disaggregated by geographic region. Because our CODM evaluates financial performance on a consolidated basis, we have determined that we have a single operating segment composed of the consolidated financial results of Snap Inc.

The measure used by our CODM to assess performance and make operating decisions is net loss as reported on our consolidated statements of operations. Net loss is used by our CODM to identify underlying trends in the performance of our business and make comparisons with the financial performance of our competitors. Our CODM also reviews total assets, as reported on our consolidated balance sheets, and purchases of property and equipment, as reported on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Our CODM also utilizes expense information in order to assess our financial performance. Infrastructure costs primarily consist of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products, which include expenses related to storage, computing, and bandwidth. Content and developer partner costs primarily consist of fees paid to our content creators and publisher partners who share content on our platform through revenue sharing arrangements. Advertising partner and other costs primarily consist of payments to third-party partners for fulfillment services, credit card and other transaction processing fees, and other expenses directly related to providing our services. Operating expenses include all remaining costs necessary to operate our business, which primarily include personnel expenses, facilities and related costs, promotional and marketing expenses, external professional services, and other administrative expenses. Operating expenses include charges recognized as research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations, but exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll and other tax expenses, depreciation and amortization, and restructuring charges, which are independently reviewed by our CODM.

The following table presents the significant segment expenses and other segment items regularly reviewed by our CODM:
