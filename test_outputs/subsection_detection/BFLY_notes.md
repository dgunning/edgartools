The entire disclosure for organization, consolidation and basis of presentation of financial statements disclosure.

## SECTION: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BFLY Operations, Inc. (formerly Butterfly Network, Inc.) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the accounting disclosure rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Functional Currency

The Company’s worldwide operations utilize the U.S. dollar (“USD”) as the functional currency considering the significant dependency of each subsidiary on the Company. Subsidiary operations are financed through the funding received from the Company in USD. For foreign entities where the USD is the functional currency, all foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at end-of-period exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market accounts with one financial institution. The Company also maintains balances in various operating accounts above federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any significant losses on such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, one customer and no customers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenue.

Segment Information

The Company has determined that it operates in one reportable segment, which includes all activities related to the development, manufacture, and sale of the Company's products, software, and other services. The Company’s chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), its chief executive officer ("CEO"), regularly reviews the Company's consolidated net loss, which is reported as net loss and comprehensive loss on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, for purposes of evaluating the Company's financial performance, including reviewing budget versus actual results, and determining changes in the Company's allocation of resources across the Company's strategic initiatives. The Company's measure of segment assets is total assets, as reported on the consolidated balance sheets, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived assets are located in the United States.

In addition to the operating expenses presented on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, the CODM also reviews certain significant segment expenses. The following table summarizes the Company's segment revenue and significant segment expenses included in consolidated net loss (in thousands):


#### Table: Year ended December 31,
| label | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Revenue | $82,056 | $65,900 | $73,390 |
| Less: |  |  |  |
| Cost of revenue | 33,225 | 49,044 | 33,930 |
| Payroll operating expenses | 57,334 | 67,241 | 111,361 |
| Stock-based compensation expense | 21,032 | 27,480 | 42,531 |
| Non-payroll operating expenses | 40,811 | 49,581 | 71,242 |
| Other | 4,065 | 18,164 | 7,346 |
| Other segment items | (1,919) | (11,910) | (24,297) |
| Net loss | $(72,492) | $(133,700) | $(168,723) |



Other segment items include interest income, interest expense, the change in fair value of warrant liabilities, other income (expense), net, and the provision (benefit) for income taxes.

Because the Company operates in one reportable segment, other required segment disclosures are included on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Interest income, interest expense, and the provision (benefit) for income taxes are included on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Depreciation, amortization, and impairments; write-down of inventories; and purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets, including capitalized software, are included on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions. Significant estimates and assumptions include:

•revenue recognition, including determination of the timing and pattern of satisfaction of performance obligations and determination of the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations;

•measurement and allocation of capitalized costs, the net realizable value (the selling price as well as estimated costs of completion, disposal and transportation) of inventory, and demand and future use of inventory;

•assumptions underlying the capitalization of costs to develop or obtain software for internal use;

•assumptions underlying incremental borrowing rate calculations;

•assumptions underlying the measurement of contingent losses; and

•assumptions underlying the fair value used in the stock-based compensation expense calculation.

The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions about future events. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”). Revenue is recognized when or as a customer obtains control of the promised goods and services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for these goods and services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five steps:

•Step 1: Identify Contracts with Customers: The Company typically enters into contracts with customers through direct sales executed via signed contracts with payment terms of 30 days or less. Multi-year software subscriptions typically require advance payment for each annual subscription period.

•Step 2: Identify Performance Obligations: The Company’s contracts with customers often include multiple performance obligations. The Company has identified the following performance obligations in its contracts with customers:

•Hardware devices and accessories;

•Software subscriptions, including renewal subscriptions, which represent an obligation to provide the customer with ongoing access to the Company’s cloud-hosted software applications on a continuous basis throughout the subscription period;

•Implementation and integration services;

•Extended warranties; and

•SDKs, either perpetual or term-based.

•Step 3: Determine Transaction Price: The Company’s contracts with customers include variable consideration in the form of refunds and credits for product returns and price concessions. The Company estimates variable consideration based on the individual contract circumstances or by using the expected value method based on a portfolio of data from similar contracts, depending on the circumstances.

•Step 4: Allocate Transaction Price to Performance Obligations: The Company allocates transaction price to the performance obligations in contracts with customers based on the relative SSPs of the underlying goods and services which the Company has a history of selling to customers on a standalone basis.

•Step 5: Recognize Revenue as Performance Obligations are Satisfied: Each sale of a hardware device, accessory, or perpetual SDK is a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time when control of the good transfers from the Company to the customer based on shipping terms or when the SDK is provided to the customer. The Company’s software subscriptions and extended warranties are stand-ready performance obligations that are satisfied over time by providing the customer with ongoing access to the Company’s resources. Term-based SDK sales are performance obligations that are satisfied over time through continued provision of access to the customer. The Company uses the time-elapsed (i.e., straight-line) measure of progress to recognize revenue as these performance obligations are satisfied evenly over the respective service periods. The implementation and integration services are a performance obligation satisfied over time, and the Company uses the costs incurred as inputs into the measure of progress to recognize revenue as it satisfies the performance obligation.

Deferred Revenue

Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from software subscriptions and other services and is reduced as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Deferred revenue is classified as current or non-current on the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected timing of revenue recognition. The deferred revenue that will be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months is classified as current, and the deferred revenue that will be recognized thereafter is classified as non-current.

Warranties

The Company offers a standard product warranty that its products will function according to standard specifications and free of significant defects for a period ranging from one year to three years, depending on the product, from when control is transferred to the customer. The Company evaluated the warranty liability under ASC Topic 606 and determined that it is an assurance-type warranty. When product revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recognized as cost of product revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Factors that affect the estimate of future warranty costs include historical and current product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures, and warranty policies and business practices.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash and cash equivalents consist principally of cash and money market accounts.

Trade Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are recognized as the original amount invoiced less an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the probability of future collection. In accordance with ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, the Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible and collection of the receivable is no longer being actively pursued. The following table summarizes the allowance for doubtful accounts activity:


#### Table: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
| label | col_3 | col_5 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| (in thousands) | Fair Value | Fair Value |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2022 | $528 |  |
| Additions | 1,446 |  |
| Deductions – write offs | (187) |  |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2023 | 1,787 |  |
| Additions | 1,128 |  |
| Deductions – write offs | (332) |  |
| Allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2024 | $2,583 |  |



Inventories

Inventories primarily consist of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods which are purchased and held by the Company’s third-party contract manufacturers. Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost, determined using the average cost method, or net realizable value. Actual cost includes all direct and indirect production costs to convert materials into a finished product. Net realizable value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by the estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The determination of net realizable value involves certain judgments including estimating average selling prices. The Company reduces the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability by the difference between the cost of the affected inventory and the net realizable value.

The valuation of inventories also requires the Company to estimate excess and obsolete inventory. The Company considers new product development schedules, the effect that new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, product merchantability, and whether older products can be remanufactured into new products, among other factors.

Losses expected to arise from firm, non-cancelable and unhedged commitments for the future purchase of inventories are recognized unless the losses are recoverable through firm sales contracts or other means.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash includes deposits in financial institutions restricted according to an agreement and used to secure a lease agreement. The Company classifies the amount restricted according to an agreement as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as the Company expects the deposit to be released from restriction within the next twelve months. The Company classifies the amount used to secure a lease agreement within other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as the lease is long-term. The amount shown as restricted cash is included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Vendor Advances

Vendor advances represent amounts paid to third-party vendors for future services to be received related to production of the Company’s inventories. The amounts are presented net of write offs. The classification of vendor advances as current or non-current is based on the estimated timing of inventory delivery.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of related improvements.

Useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:


#### Table: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
| label | col_6 |
| --- | --- |
| Property and Equipment | Estimated Useful Life |
| Software | 3 years |
| Machinery and equipment | 3 – 5 years |
| Furniture and fixtures | 5 – 7 years |
| Leasehold improvements | Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term |



Expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of those assets and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization is eliminated from the balance sheet, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period of disposal.

Capitalized Software Development Costs

Costs to develop or obtain software for internal use are capitalized and recorded as capitalized software development costs on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of property and equipment. The Company capitalizes qualifying costs associated with internal-use software incurred during the application development stage if management with relevant authority authorizes the project, it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages, including training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are amortized on a project-by-project basis using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the software, which is three years, beginning when the software is substantially ready for use. Amortization expense is classified in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on the nature of the software.

Leases

The Company primarily enters into leases for office space that are classified as operating leases. The Company determines if an agreement is or contains a lease at inception. The Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases, by recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company classifies right-of-use assets as operating lease assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company classifies the current portion of lease liabilities, representing lease payments due within the next twelve months, as accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company classifies the non-current portion of lease liabilities as operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by an option to extend that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Generally, the Company may terminate its leases with the notice required in the lease agreement and upon payment of a termination fee, if required. The Company’s leases do not include substantial variable payments based on indexes or rates. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.

The Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit discount rate. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate an interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in similar economic environments. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company recognizes a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and the Company includes all cash payments within cash flows from operating activities as the change in operating lease assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Company does not have any finance leases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including its property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets, and operating lease assets, for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If the recorded value of the asset is less than the undiscounted cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.

Warrant Liability

The Company’s outstanding warrants include publicly-traded warrants (the “Public Warrants”), which were issued as one-third of a warrant per unit during the Company’s initial public offering on May 26, 2020 (the “IPO”), and warrants sold in a private placement to Longview’s sponsor (the “Private Warrants”). The Company evaluated its warrants under ASC Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity, and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity. Since the Public Warrants and Private Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, the Company recorded these warrants as non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value upon the closing of the Business Combination, with subsequent changes in their respective fair values recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each reporting date. See Note 15 "Warrants" for additional information about our warrants.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of product revenue includes manufacturing costs, personnel costs and benefits, inbound freight, packaging, warranty replacement costs, payment processing fees, and inventory obsolescence and write-offs. Cost of software and other services revenue includes personnel costs, cloud hosting costs, amortization of capitalized software development costs, and payment processing fees.

Research and Development

R&D expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and benefits, facilities expenses, consulting and professional fees, fabrication services, software, and other outsourcing expenses. Substantially all of the Company’s R&D expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving existing products and services. R&D expenses are expensed as incurred.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and benefits, third-party logistics, fulfillment and outbound shipping costs, facilities expenses, advertising, and travel and entertainment. Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, advertising expenses were $4.3 million, $4.3 million and $5.8 million, respectively.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and benefits, insurance, patent fees, software costs, facilities costs, and outside services. Outside services consist of professional services, legal fees, and other professional fees.

Operating Expenses – Other

The Company classifies certain operating expenses that are not representative of its ongoing operations as other on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These include costs related to the Company’s business transformation initiative, reductions in force, litigation, and legal settlements.

The following table summarizes the types of expenses classified as other in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):


#### Table: Year ended December 31,
| label | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Employment-related expenses | $1,341 | $8,701 | $2,019 |
| Legal-related expenses | 2,724 | 9,463 | 5,327 |
| **Total other** | **$4,065** | **$18,164** | **$7,346** |



On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with a third-party global technology and business transformation partner to optimize and lower the cost of certain non-specialized technical functions. As part of the transition into this new partnership, a portion of the Company's workforce will be in lower-cost geographies. The Company incurred $0.7 million of severance costs for impacted employees that continued providing transition services to the Company through the end of 2024. These costs were recognized as other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, a total of $0.7 million of accrued severance related to our global workforce optimization is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Net Loss per Common Share

We compute net loss per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of each class of the Company’s common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all of the Company’s potential common shares outstanding of the Company’s common stock to the extent the potential shares are dilutive. Basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for each period presented in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as the inclusion of all potential shares of the Company’s common stock would have been anti-dilutive. Refer to Note 12 “Net Loss Per Share” for further discussion.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

The measurement of stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards, including stock options and RSUs granted to employees, directors, and nonemployees as well as the Company's ESPP, is based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date.

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for its awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which is generally the vesting period. Generally, stock option and RSU awards fully vest three to four years from the grant date, and stock options have a contractual term of 10 years. ESPP options generally vest over two years. The Company recognizes the effect of forfeitures in stock-based compensation expense based on actual forfeitures when they occur.

The Company granted performance-based restricted stock units during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The Company accounted for these awards according to the relevant provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. For performance-based awards, the Company recognizes expense using the accelerated attribution method. Refer to Note 11 “Stock-Based Compensation” for further discussion about the nature of the Company's stock-based compensation transactions.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax

expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which introduced new guidance on disclosures for reportable segments and significant segment expenses, including for entities with a single reportable segment. The Company retrospectively adopted this guidance during the year ended December 31, 2024. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements, other than the newly required disclosures.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which introduced new guidance on disclosures for income taxes, including enhancements to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. This guidance is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this pronouncement will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which introduced new guidance on disclosures of specified information about certain costs and expenses included within expenses presented on the face or the income statements, such as purchases of inventory and employee compensation. This guidance is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2027 and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2028. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this pronouncement will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Disaggregation of Revenue

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by product type and by geographical market. The Company believes that these categories aggregate the payor types by nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of its revenue streams. The following table summarizes the Company’s disaggregated revenues (in thousands) for the years ended December 31:


#### Table: By product type:
| label | Pattern of Recognition | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| By product type: |  |  |  |  |
| Devices and accessories | Point-in-time | $54,200 | $40,036 | $50,263 |
| Software and other services | Over time | 27,856 | 25,864 | 23,127 |
| **Total revenue** |  | **$82,056** | **$65,900** | **$73,390** |
| By geographical market: |  |  |  |  |
| United States |  | $63,423 | $52,116 | $51,072 |
| International |  | 18,633 | 13,784 | 22,318 |
| **Total revenue** |  | **$82,056** | **$65,900** | **$73,390** |



Contract Balances

Contract balances represent amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets when the Company has either transferred goods or services to the customer or the customer has paid consideration to the Company under the contract. These contract balances include trade accounts receivable and deferred revenue. The Company recognizes a receivable when it has an unconditional right to payment, and payment terms are typically 30 days for product and software and other services sales on credit. The amount of revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was $15.6 million and $14.9 million, respectively.

Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $33.3 million of remaining performance obligations. The Company expects to recognize approximately 64% of its remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next twelve months and approximately 36% thereafter.

Costs of Obtaining or Fulfilling Contracts

The Company incurs incremental costs of obtaining contracts and costs of fulfilling contracts with customers. Incremental costs of obtaining contracts, which include commissions and referral fees paid to third parties as a result of obtaining contracts with customers, are capitalized to the extent that the Company expects to recover such costs. Costs of fulfilling contracts that relate specifically to a contract with a customer, which result from activities that generate resources for the Company and enable the Company to satisfy its performance obligations in the contract with the customer, are capitalized to the extent that the Company expects to recover such costs. Capitalized costs are amortized in a pattern that is consistent with the Company’s transfer of the related goods and services to the customer. The Company had $0.7 million and $1.4 million of capitalized costs of obtaining or fulfilling contracts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s amortization costs for capitalized costs of obtaining or fulfilling contracts were $0.7 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company’s amortization costs for capitalized costs of obtaining or fulfilling contracts was not significant for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Practical Expedients and Accounting Policy Elections

In determining the transaction price of its contracts with customers, the Company estimates variable consideration using a portfolio of data from similar contracts.

As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component in contracts in which the period between when the Company transfers the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service is a year or less.

The Company has made an accounting policy election to exclude all sales taxes from the transaction price of its contracts with customers. Accordingly, sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are not included in revenue and are accounted for as a liability until they have been remitted to the respective government authority.

The entire disclosure of revenue from contract with customer to transfer good or service and to transfer nonfinancial asset. Includes, but is not limited to, disaggregation of revenue, credit loss recognized from contract with customer, judgment and change in judgment related to contract with customer, and asset recognized from cost incurred to obtain or fulfill contract with customer. Excludes insurance and lease contracts.

## SECTION: Fair Value of Financial Instruments
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

Fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial instruments. As these estimates are subjective in nature, involving uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, they cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair value.

The Company measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The Company utilizes a three-tier hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:

•Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.

•Level 2 — Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•Level 3 — Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company has no assets or liabilities valued with Level 3 inputs.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximates their fair values due to the short-term or on demand nature of these instruments.

There were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company determined the fair value of its Public Warrants as Level 1 financial instruments, as they are traded in active markets. Because any transfer of Private Warrants from the initial holder of the Private Warrants would result in the Private Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, management determined that the fair value of each Private Warrant is the same as that of a Public Warrant. Accordingly, the Private Warrants are classified as Level 2 financial instruments.

The following table summarizes the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

Equity incentive plans

The Company’s 2012 Employee, Director and Consultant Equity Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan") was approved by the Board and the Company’s stockholders in March 2012. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company has not granted and will not grant any additional awards under the 2012 Plan. However, the 2012 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder. As of December 31, 2024, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2012 Plan was 4.8 million.

The Butterfly Network, Inc. Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”, and together with the 2012 Plan, the “Plans”) was approved by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2020 and by the Company's stockholders in the first quarter of 2021. The 2020 Plan is administered by the Board. The Board may grant stock-based awards, restricted stock, and options to purchase shares either as incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. The restricted stock and options grants are subject to certain terms and conditions, option periods and conditions, exercise rights, and privileges and are fully discussed in the 2020 Plan. Grants under the Plans are included in the tables below.

As of December 31, 2024, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan was 53.5 million and 17.2 million common shares remain available for issuance under the 2020 Plan.

Stock options

Each stock option grant carries varying vesting schedules whereby the options may be exercised at the participant’s sole discretion provided they are an employee, director or consultant of the Company on the applicable vesting date. Each option shall terminate not more than ten years from the grant date.

A summary of the stock option activity under the Plans is presented in the table below:


#### Table: Stock-Based Compensation

| Options exercisable at December 31, 2024 | 6,222,073 | 5.94 | 3.48 | 1,799 |



The total intrinsic value excludes those options whereby the stock price does not exceed the exercise price of the option.

Additional information about the Company’s stock option activity during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is presented in the table below:


#### Table: Stock-Based Compensation

The intrinsic value of a stock option that’s been exercised is the amount by which the stock price exceeds the exercise price of the option on the date of exercise.

Restricted stock units

A summary of the restricted stock unit activity under the Plans is presented in the table below:


#### Table: Stock-Based Compensation
| label | Number of Restricted Stock Units | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Outstanding at December 31, 2022 | 9,961,291 | 4.55 |
| Granted | 16,082,613 | 2.23 |
| Vested | (5,418,832) | 4.09 |

| Vested | (6,906,452) | 2.69 |
| Forfeited | (3,251,584) | 2.34 |
| Outstanding at December 31, 2024 | 21,250,230 | 1.52 |



The total fair value of the restricted stock units vested was $10.4 million, $7.3 million, and $10.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Included in the table above are performance-based restricted stock units that include certain service conditions in the award. In 2022, the Company granted 0.2 million performance-based restricted stock units to certain executives. The service condition for these awards is satisfied by providing service to the Company based on the defined service period per the award agreement. The performance-based conditions are objective performance metrics defined in the award agreement. An insignificant amount of expense was recognized for these awards during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Also included in the table above are market-based restricted stock units that include a service condition. In 2024 and 2023, the Company granted 1.0 million and 1.8 million, respectively, of these awards to certain executives. The market-based conditions for these awards are objective metrics related to the Company’s stock price defined in the award agreement. The service condition for these awards is satisfied by providing service to the Company through the achievement date of the market-based conditions. The grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the derived service period. The grant date fair value and derived service period were determined by using a Monte Carlo simulation with the risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility assumptions detailed below. The Company recognized $2.0 million and $2.5 million of expense for these awards during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Valuation assumptions

In accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, the Company estimates and records the compensation cost associated with the grants described above with an offsetting entry to paid-in capital. As described in Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, the Company selected the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value of its service-based stock option awards. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions are also used to determine the fair value of market-based awards via Monte Carlo simulations. The assumptions used to value stock option and market-based grants to employees were as follows:


#### Table: Stock-Based Compensation
| label | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Risk-free interest rate | 3.6% | 3.6% – 3.9% | 1.7% – 3.0% |
| Expected dividend yield | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Expected term | 5.0 years | 5.0 years | 5.8 years – 6.5 years |
| Expected volatility | 89% | 76% | 70% – 73% |



The Company did not grant any stock options during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company did not grant any stock options or market-based awards to non-employees during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Risk-free interest rate

The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the awards is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the grant date.

Expected dividend yield

The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Expected term

For employee stock option awards, the Company calculates the expected term using the “simplified” method, which is the simple average of the vesting period and the contractual term. The simplified method is applied as the Company does not have sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis for an estimate of the expected term. The Company calculates the expected term for employee stock option awards that take into account the effects of employee’s expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. For non-employee stock option awards, the expected term is determined on an award by award basis. For market-based awards, the expected term is based on the length of the award's performance period.

Expected volatility

The Company considers the historical volatility of its stock price and the implied stock price volatility derived from the price of exchange-traded options on the Company's stock. Because Legacy Butterfly was privately held from its inception until the closing of the Business Combination in 2021, there was no specific historical or implied volatility information available prior to 2021. Accordingly, when the Company calculates the historical stock price volatility for awards with expected terms greater than the length of time since the closing of the Business Combination, the Company supplements its own historical stock price volatility with the historical stock price volatility of a group of publicly-traded peer companies that are publicly traded over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards.

Exercise price

The exercise price is taken directly from the grant notice issued to employees and non-employees.

Award accelerations and modifications

On December 30, 2022, the Company’s then CEO resigned from his position. Pursuant to the separation agreement between the CEO and the Company, he received equity-based compensation including the acceleration of vesting of 1.7 million of the CEO’s service-based stock options and service-based restricted stock units. This acceleration was pursuant to the original award agreements. As a modification to the original award agreements, 0.1 million performance-based restricted stock units had an acceleration of vesting, and 0.3 million service-based stock options had their post-employment exercise period extended. The Company recognized a total of $7.8 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the acceleration of these awards pursuant to the original award agreements and the modifications to the original award agreements. The incremental stock-based compensation expense resulting from the modifications was not significant.

Employee stock purchase plan

The Company’s 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) was approved by the Board and the Company’s stockholders in the second quarter of 2024, with 4.2 million shares of common stock initially reserved and available for issuance. Under the ESPP, each eligible employee is granted an option to purchase shares of common stock, with the purchase price paid through payroll deductions, subject to the plan’s limitations on the number and value of shares purchasable. Each offering period under the ESPP has an expected duration of 24 months, divided into four six-month purchase periods, with purchases occurring in June and December. The purchase price per share is equal to the lower of 85% of the closing market price on the first day of the offering period, or 85% of the closing market price on the applicable purchase date. Proceeds received from the issuance of shares are credited to stockholders’ equity in the period that the shares are issued. The grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The grant date fair value was determined using similar methods and assumptions as those used for the Company’s stock option awards granted under its equity incentive plans. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's employees purchased 671,435 shares of newly issued common stock through the ESPP.

Stock-based compensation expense

The Company’s stock-based compensation expense for the periods presented was as follows (in thousands):


#### Table: Year ended December 31,
| label | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |

No related tax benefits of the stock-based compensation expense have been recognized and no related tax benefits have been realized from the exercise of stock options due to the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards and valuation allowance. The Company has capitalized $0.4 million, $0.7 million and $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense as part of the cost of its capitalized internally developed software assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2024 was $21.1 million which will be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of 1.9 years.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of each class of the Company’s common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of the Company’s common stock, including those presented in the table below, to the extent dilutive. Basic and diluted net loss per share were the same for each period presented as the inclusion of all potential shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding would have been anti-dilutive.

As the Company uses the two-class method required for companies with multiple classes of common stock, the following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share for each class of the Company’s common stock outstanding (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):

For the periods presented above, the net loss per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per-share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Company’s certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated. The undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.

The Company recorded a tax benefit of $0.03 million, a tax provision of $0.08 million, and a tax provision of $0.04 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to foreign income and return to provision adjustments. Due to the Company’s loss position domestically, the Company has not recorded a significant federal tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

A reconciliation of the Company’s statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $634.8 million and $609.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $446.1 million and $407.8 million, respectively. Of the $634.8 million of federal NOL carryforwards, $73.7 million will begin to expire at various dates in 2031 and $561.2 million may be carried forward indefinitely. The state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had federal and state tax credits of $15.4 million and $2.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2032 and 2024, respectively.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in significant changes to the treatment of research and experimental (“R&E”) expenditures under Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (“IRC”). For tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, companies are required to capitalize and amortize all R&E expenditures that are paid or incurred in connection with their trade or business. Specifically, costs for U.S. based R&E activities must be amortized over five years. Previously, these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. The implementation of this provision didn’t increase our cash income tax payment in 2024 due to our significant pre-tax net loss.

Future realization of the tax benefits of existing temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company performed an evaluation to determine whether a valuation allowance was needed. The Company considered

all available evidence, both positive and negative, which included the results of operations for the current and preceding years. The Company determined that it was not possible to reasonably quantify future taxable income and determined that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against its net U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The deferred tax asset recognized relates entirely to the Company's foreign entities.

The Company’s valuation allowance increased by $8.7 million and $34.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due primarily to the generation of NOLs.

The utilization of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that have occurred previously or may occur in the future. Under IRC Sections 382 and 383, a corporation that undergoes an ownership change may be subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes otherwise available to offset future taxable income and/or tax liability. An ownership change is defined as a cumulative change of 50% or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders during a rolling three-year period. The Company conducted an ownership analysis under IRC Section 382 based upon publicly available information as of December 31, 2024 and determined that there has not been an ownership change since the last ownership change event on February 12, 2021 that would limit the Company’s utilization of its NOLs and tax credits.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations for both federal taxes and the many states in which the Company operates or does business. ASC 740-10 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, on the basis of the technical merits.

The Company records uncertain tax positions as liabilities in accordance with ASC 740-10 and adjusts these liabilities when the Company’s judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not recorded any uncertain tax positions in its financial statements.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no significant accrued interest or penalties.

The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending tax examinations. The Company’s tax years are still open under statute from December 31, 2020 to the present. Federal and state net operating losses are subject to review by taxing authorities in the year utilized.

From time to time, the Company applies for government assistance in the form of non-income tax refundable credits based on meeting various eligibility criteria. To account for government assistance, where there is limited GAAP guidance for for-profit entities, the Company analogizes to International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosures of Government Assistance. Under that standard, the Company recognizes government assistance when there is reasonable assurance that it will comply with the relevant conditions and that the assistance will be received.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received a tax credit paid in cash of $0.9 million under the state of Massachusetts Life Sciences Tax Incentive Program and recorded the receipt as other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The government grant is subject to claw-back if the Company fails to meet certain targets in the tax year following the time of the award. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined that it did not ultimately meet the required targets in 2022 and expects to repay the tax credit received. As a result, the Company has accrued $0.9 million for the expected repayment in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the Company recognized a corresponding expense in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company received a tax credit paid in cash of $0.5 million for the U.S. government's Employee Retention Credit and recorded the receipt as other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

## SECTION: Warrants
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Warrants Warrants Public Warrants The Company issued Public Warrants and Private Warrants in connection with its IPO in 2020. As of December 31, 2024, there were an aggregate of 13,799,357 outstanding Public Warrants, which entitle the holder to acquire Class A common stock. Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, beginning on May 26, 2021. The warrants will expire on February 12, 2026 or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the amount of exercises of Public Warrants was not significant, and the amount reclassified into equity upon the exercise of the Public Warrants was not significant. Redemptions At any time while the warrants are exercisable, the Company may redeem not less than all of the outstanding Public Warrants: • at a price of $0.01 per warrant; • upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; • provided that the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and for certain issuances of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and • provided that there is an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and a current prospectus relating thereto, available through the 30-day redemption period or the Company has elected to require the exercise of the warrants on a “cashless basis” (as described below). If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Company issues a notice of redemption of the Public Warrants at $0.01 per warrant, each holder of Public Warrants will be entitled to exercise their Public Warrants prior to the scheduled redemption date. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption for $0.01 as described above, the Board may elect to require any holder that wishes to exercise a Public Warrant to do so on a “cashless basis.” If the Board makes such election, all holders of Public Warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the “fair market value.” For purposes of the redemption provisions of the warrants, the “fair market value” means the average last reported sale price of the Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. The Company may also redeem not less than all of the outstanding Public Warrants and Private Warrants: • at $0.10 per warrant; • upon a minimum of 30 days' prior written notice of redemption; • provided that the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted per stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, reclassifications, recapitalizations and the like) on the trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; • provided that the Private Warrants are also concurrently exchanged at the same price (equal to a number of shares of Class A common stock) as the outstanding Public Warrants; and • provided that there is an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating thereto available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and the Company issues a notice of redemption of the warrants at $0.10 per warrant, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise their warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date on a cashless basis and receive that number of shares based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” of the Class A common stock, in accordance with a table set forth in the warrant agreement. The Company evaluated the Public Warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity , in conjunction with the SEC Division of Corporation Finance’s April 12, 2021 Public Statement, Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPACs”) , and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity. Specifically, the exercise of the warrants may be settled in cash upon the occurrence of a tender offer or exchange offer in which the maker of the tender offer or exchange offer, upon completion of the tender offer or exchange offer, beneficially owns more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, even if it would not result in a change of control of the Company. This provision would preclude the warrants from being classified in equity and thus the warrants are classified as a liability. Private Warrants As of December 31, 2024 , there were 6,853,333 Private Warrants outstanding. There have been no exercises of the Private Warrants. The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that so long as they are held by Longview Investors LLC (the “Sponsor”) or any of its permitted transferees, (i) the Private Warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Warrants are not transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination, (ii) the Private Warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and (iii) the Private Warrants are not subject to the Company’s redemption option at the price of $0.01 per warrant. The Private Warrants are subject to the Company’s redemption option at the price of $0.10 per warrant, provided that the other conditions of such redemption are met, as described above. If the Private Warrants are held by a holder other than the Sponsor or any of its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios applicable to the Public Warrants and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Company evaluated the Private Warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity , in conjunction with the SEC Division of Corporation Finance’s April 12, 2021 Public Statement, Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPACs”) , and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in stockholders’ equity. Specifically, the terms of the warrants provide for potential changes to the settlement amounts dependent upon the characteristics of the warrant holder, and, because the holder of a warrant is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares, such provision would preclude the warrant from being classified in equity and thus the warrants are classified as a liability. The Company recognized a loss of $1.9 million, a gain of $4.5 million, and a gain of $20.9 million for the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## SECTION: Leases
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

The Company primarily enters into leases for office space that are classified as operating leases. Most leases are not cancelable prior to their expiration.

The Company terminated one of its operating leases for office space and modified another during the third quarter of 2023 that increased its lease payments by $0.2 million. The Company recognized a total decrease of $4.2 million to operating lease assets, $0.7 million to the current portion of operating lease liabilities included in accrued expenses and other current

liabilities, and $4.7 million to the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for the lease termination and lease modification. As part of the lease termination, the Company agreed to forfeit a $0.9 million security deposit included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognized a $0.2 million gain on lease termination within operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The following table presents the components of operating lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands):

## SECTION: Commitments and Contingencies
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Commitments and Contingencies Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Purchase commitments: The Company enters into inventory purchase commitments with third-party manufacturers in the ordinary course of business, including a non-cancellable inventory supply agreement with a certain third-party manufacturing vendor. The provisions of the agreement allowed the Company, once it reached a certain cumulative purchase threshold in the fourth quarter of 2021, to pay for a portion of the subsequent inventory purchases using an advance previously paid to the vendor. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of minimum inventory purchase commitments is $6.9 million and the Company has a vendor advance asset of $3.1 million, net of write-downs, and an insignificant accrued purchase commitment liability. The portion of the balances that is expected to be utilized in the next twelve months is included in current assets and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company applied the guidance in ASC Topic 330, Inventory , to assess the purchase commitment and related loss, using such factors as Company-specific forecasts which are reliant on the Company’s limited sales history, agreement-specific provisions, macroeconomic factors, and market and industry trends. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not recognize any additions to the accrued purchase commitment liability, or any related losses, based on its purchase commitment assessment as there were no significant changes to the assessment factors. The Company reviews its inventory on hand, including inventory acquired under the purchase commitments, for excess and obsolescence (“E&O”) on a quarterly basis. Any E&O inventory acquired that was previously accounted for as a purchase commitment liability accrual or vendor advance write-down is recorded at zero value. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not acquire such E&O inventory. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company utilized $2.0 million of the accrued purchase commitment liability to acquire such E&O inventory. Contingencies The Company is involved in litigation and legal matters from time to time, which have arisen in the normal course of business. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal contingencies when the Company considers a potential loss probable and can reasonably estimate the amount of the potential loss. Although the ultimate results of these matters are not currently determinable, management does not expect that they will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or statements of cash flows. On February 16, 2022, a putative class action lawsuit, styled Rose v. Butterfly Network, Inc., et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The claims are against the Company and certain of its directors and previous management as well as members of the board of directors of the Company prior to the completion of the Business Combination, alleging that the defendants made false and misleading statements and/or omissions about its post-Business Combination business and financial prospects. The alleged class consists of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s stock between January 12, 2021 and November 15, 2021, persons who exchanged Longview shares for the Company’s common stock, and persons who purchased Longview stock pursuant, or traceable to, the Proxy/Registration Statement filed with the SEC on November 27, 2020 or any amendment thereto. The Company intends to vigorously defend against this action. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, together with interest thereon, as well as the costs and expenses of litigation. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of the litigation or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any potential settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of the action. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time. On June 21, 2022, a stockholder derivative action, styled Koenig v. Todd M. Fruchterman, et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company’s board of directors and the Company as nominal defendant. On November 28, 2023, a stockholder derivative action, styled Bhavsar v. Todd M. Fruchterman, et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the board of directors and the Company as nominal defendant. Both these actions allege violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and claims for breach of fiduciary duty, contribution and indemnification, aiding and abetting, and gross mismanagement. The lawsuits are premised upon allegedly inadequate internal controls and purportedly misleading representations regarding the Company’s financial condition, business prospects, and the Company’s November 2021 earnings announcement. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these actions. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement, and restitution, together with interest thereon, as well as the costs and expenses of litigation. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in the defense of the litigation or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any potential settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of the action. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.

## SECTION: Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy Disclosure
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Cybersecurity Risk Management Processes for Assessing, Identifying, and Managing Threats [Text Block] Butterfly Network, Inc. uses, stores, and processes data for and about our customers, employees, partners, and suppliers. We have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program that is designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks from cybersecurity threats to this data and our systems. Risk Management Strategy and Governance Under the ultimate direction of our Chief Executive Officer, our Information Security Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our management of cybersecurity risks. It is chaired by our Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO") who reports directly to our Chief Technology Officer. Other members of the committee include representation from information technology, quality, product, operations, sales, and compliance as well as advisory support from internal audit. Our CISO, working with his team and the Information Security Committee, has primary responsibility for assessing and managing our cybersecurity threat management program. The current CISO has more than 20 years of experience in building and leading security, risk management, and compliance organizations across several industries, including med-tech, healthcare, and financial services, and many of these companies include highly-regulated Fortune 500 companies. The current CISO is an expert in NIST 800-53 (Rev-5), ISO27001, and other national and international security risk management disciplines. The Information Security Committee meets periodically and as circumstances warrant to discuss and monitor prevention, detection, and remediation of risks from cybersecurity threats. When appropriate, cyber or information security incidents would be escalated by the CISO to our executive leadership team and/or our disclosure committee. On a regular basis, the CISO also updates the executive management team on developments within the cybersecurity sphere. The Board of Directors has delegated oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity program to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. As provided in the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing reports on data management, security initiatives, significant existing and emerging cybersecurity risks, including cybersecurity incidents, the impact on the Company and its stakeholders of any significant cybersecurity incident, and any disclosure obligations arising from any such incidents. Our CISO meets at least quarterly with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to discuss management’s ongoing cybersecurity risk management programs. He provides information about the sources and nature of risks the Company faces, how management assesses such risks – including in terms of likelihood and severity of impact, progress on vulnerability remediation, and current developments in the cybersecurity landscape. In turn, the Chair of the Audit Committee provides a readout to the full Board of Directors that includes a summary of the CISO’s presentation to enable discussion of cybersecurity risk management at the full board level. Although risks from cybersecurity threats have to date not materially affected, and we do not believe they are reasonably likely to materially affect, us, our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, we could, from time to time, experience threats and security incidents relating to our and our third party vendors’ information systems. For more information, please see Part I, Item 1A “ Risk Factors .” Processes for the Identification of Cybersecurity Threats Our Information Security team is responsible for monitoring our information systems for vulnerabilities and mitigating any issues. It works with other groups in the Company to understand the severity and the likelihood of the potential consequences of a cybersecurity incident and to make decisions about how to prioritize mitigation and other initiatives based on, among other things, materiality to the business. The Information Security team has processes designed to keep the Company apprised of the different threats in the cybersecurity landscape – this includes intelligence networks alerts, working with researchers, discussions with peers at other companies, monitoring social media, reviewing government alerts and other news items, and attending security conferences. The team also regularly monitors our internal network and our customer-facing network to identify security risks. In addition, the team has completed several assessments and threat modeling tabletop exercises, based on “what-if” scenarios. We have a mandatory employee education program that is designed to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats to reduce our vulnerability as well as to encourage consideration of cybersecurity risks across functions. Security training is required upon hire for new employees, and on an annual basis for the rest of the workforce. As part of the assessment of the protections we have in place to mitigate risks from cybersecurity threats, we engage third parties to conduct vendor risk assessments. To assess the effectiveness of our program, we also have engaged consultants to conduct penetration testing and other vulnerability assessment. Before purchasing third-party technology or other solutions that involve exposure to the Company’s assets and electronic information, our Information Technology group requires those companies to complete a security review before being approved to work with the Company. We utilize an external tool to manage critical vendors. Vendors are assessed to determine inherent and residual risk. Annually, the security team conducts a risk assessment that is informed by industry standards. The Risk Assessment consists of: • Listing the vulnerabilities company assets are exposed to; • Identifying the threats that may exploit such vulnerabilities; • Calculating inherent risk rating based on impact and exploitability; and • Calculating residual risk by assessing mitigating controls
