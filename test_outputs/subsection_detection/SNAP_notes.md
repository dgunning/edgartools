## SECTION: Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

Snap Inc. is a technology company.

Snap Inc. (“we,” “our,” or “us”), a Delaware corporation, is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Our flagship product, Snapchat, is a visual messaging application that was created to help people communicate through short videos and images called “Snaps.”


### Basis of Presentation


Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snap Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on December 31. Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior periods to conform to the current year’s presentation. None of these reclassifications had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.


### Use of Estimates


The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Management’s estimates are based on historical information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Key estimates relate primarily to determining the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, evaluation of contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and the fair value of strategic investments. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates our estimates compared to historical experience and trends, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.


### Concentrations of Business Risk


We currently use both Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for our hosting requirements. A disruption or loss of service from one or both of these partners could seriously harm our ability to operate. Although we believe there are other qualified providers that can provide these services, a transition to a new provider could create a significant disruption to our business and negatively impact our consolidated financial statements.


### Concentrations of Credit Risk


Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. We maintain cash deposits, cash equivalent balances, and marketable securities with several financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents may be withdrawn or redeemed on demand. We believe that the financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances. We also maintain investments in U.S. government debt and agency securities, publicly traded equity securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and commercial paper that carry high credit ratings and accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances.

We extend credit to our customers based on an evaluation of their ability to pay amounts due under contractual arrangement and generally do not obtain or require collateral.


### Revenue Recognition


Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 2 for additional information.


### Cost of Revenue


Cost of revenue includes payments for infrastructure, content and developer partner costs, and advertiser partner and other costs. Infrastructure costs primarily consist of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products, which include expenses related to storage, computing, and bandwidth. Content and developer partner costs primarily consist of fees paid to our content creators and publisher partners who share content on our platform through revenue sharing arrangements. Under these arrangements, we pay a portion of the fees we receive from advertisers for Snap Ads that are displayed within partner content on Snapchat. Advertising partner and other costs primarily consist of payments to third-party partners for fulfillment services, credit card and other transaction processing fees, and other expenses directly related to providing our services.

Cost of revenue includes personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in the delivery of our services. Cost of revenue also includes facilities and other supporting overhead costs, including depreciation and amortization, and inventory costs.


### Advertising


Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and recorded within sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, advertising costs were $57.7 million, $24.9 million, and $42.7 million, respectively.


### Capital Structure


We have three classes of authorized common stock – Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock. Class A common stockholders have no voting rights, Class B common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share, and Class C common stockholders are entitled to ten votes per share. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Shares of our Class C common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class B common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class B common stock upon transfer.

Future Stock Split to be Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend

In July 2022, our board of directors determined that it was advisable and in our best interest to approve a stock split to be effected in the form of a special dividend of one share of Class A common stock on each outstanding share of our common stock at a future date (the “Future Stock Split”). In connection with the Future Stock Split, we entered into certain agreements (the “Co-Founder Agreements”) with Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, our co-founders, and certain of their respective affiliates requiring them, among other things, to convert shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock into Class A common stock under certain circumstances. In May 2024, the conditions for the declaration of such dividends were modified and the Co-Founder Agreements were amended to reflect such modifications. As modified, the Future Stock Split will not be declared and paid until the first business day following the date on which (i) the average of the volume weighted average price (the “VWAP”) per share of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $40 per share for 90 consecutive trading days (the “90-Day VWAP”) and (ii) the ratio of the 90-Day VWAP to $8.70 equals or exceeds the ratio of the average closing price of the S&P 500 Total Return index for the same 90 trading days for which the 90-Day VWAP was calculated to 8,862.85. If this does not occur by July 21, 2032, the Future Stock Split will not be declared and paid, and the Co-Founder Agreements will terminate.

No adjustments have been made to share or per share amounts for Class A common stock in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the effects of the Future Stock Split as these triggering conditions have not been met.


### Stock-based Compensation


We measure and recognize compensation expense for stock-based payment awards, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) granted to employees, directors, and advisors, based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock-based compensation for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the period during which services are provided in exchange for the award. The grant date fair value of RSUs and RSAs is estimated based on the fair value of our underlying common stock.

RSUs and RSAs vest on the satisfaction of a service-based condition. The service condition for RSUs and RSAs is generally satisfied in equal monthly or quarterly installments over three or four years. For these awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

Stock-based compensation expense recognized for all periods presented is based on awards that are expected to vest, including an estimate of forfeitures. We estimate the forfeiture rate using historical forfeitures of equity awards and other expected changes in facts and circumstances, if any. A modification of the terms of a stock-based award is treated as an exchange of the original award for a new award with total compensation cost equal to the grant-date fair value of the original award plus the incremental value of the modification to the award.

The total recognized tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense for all periods presented was immaterial as we have established valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The majority of the future tax benefits that arise on settlement of RSUs, RSAs and stock options are in jurisdictions for which our net deferred tax assets have a full valuation allowance.


### Income Taxes


We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.

In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. Based on the level of historical losses, we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in our consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. We recognize interest and penalties associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on our consolidated balance sheets.

Currency Translation and Remeasurement

The functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at the average exchange rates during the period. Equity transactions and other non-monetary assets are remeasured using historical exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations. For those foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.


### Restricted Cash


Restricted cash primarily includes cash and cash equivalents that are legally restricted as to withdrawal or use in our operations. Restricted cash balances are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.


### Marketable Securities


We hold investments in marketable securities consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and publicly traded equity securities. We

classify marketable investments in debt securities as available-for-sale investments in our current assets because they represent investments available for current operations.

Our available-for-sale investments in debt securities are carried at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses, with any allowance for credit losses recognized as a charge in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. We did not record any credit losses on our available-for-sale debt securities in any of the periods presented. We determine gains or losses on the sale or maturities of marketable securities using the specific identification method and these gains or losses are recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.

Publicly traded equity securities are carried at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.


### Strategic Investments


We hold strategic investments primarily in privately held companies, consisting primarily of equity securities without readily determinable fair values, and to a lesser extent, debt securities. We adjust the carrying value of these equity securities to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or upon impairment. All strategic investments are reviewed periodically for impairment. Any adjustments to carrying value of these investments are recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Strategic investments are included within other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

When we exercise significant influence over, but do not control the investee, such strategic investments are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our share of the results of the investments within other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.


### Fair Value Measurements


Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Additionally, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less any allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. To determine the amount of the allowance, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluation and historical experience. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for doubtful accounts was immaterial.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three years for computer hardware, software, and equipment, five years for furniture, and over the shorter of lease term or useful life of the assets for leasehold improvements. Buildings are generally depreciated over a useful life ranging from 20 to 45 years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.


### Leases


We have non-cancelable lease agreements, primarily for offices, that are recorded as operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and do not record leases with an initial term of twelve months or less in our consolidated balance sheets. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or

terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. Certain agreements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.


### Software Development Costs


Software development costs include costs to develop software to be used to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.


### Segments


Our CEO is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). Our CEO evaluates performance and makes operating decisions about allocating resources based on financial data presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue disaggregated by geographic region. Because our CODM evaluates financial performance on a consolidated basis, we have determined that we have a single reportable segment composed of the consolidated financial results of Snap Inc.


### Business Combinations


We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire from the date of acquisition. We determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the respective date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. At the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.

When we issue payments or grants of equity to selling stockholders in connection with an acquisition, we evaluate whether the payments or awards are compensatory. This evaluation includes whether cash payments or stock award vesting is contingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for the cash to be paid or stock awards to vest, the award is treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and is recognized as compensation expense.

Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred, and are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.


### Goodwill


Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. For all periods presented, we had a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. There were no impairment charges in any of the periods presented.


### Intangible Assets


Intangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We determine the appropriate useful life of our intangible assets by measuring the expected cash flows of acquired assets. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are generally as follows:


#### Table: Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
| label | col_6 |
| --- | --- |
| Intangible Asset | Estimated Useful Life |
| Domain names | 5 years |
| Trademarks | 3 years |
| Acquired developed technology | 3 to 7 years |
| Customer relationships | 2 to 8 years |
| Patents | 4 to 14 years |




### Impairment of Long-Lived Assets


We evaluate recoverability of our property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, when events or changes indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events and changes in circumstances considered in determining whether the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in asset use, and significant negative industry or economic trends and changes in our business strategy. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated. If impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets’ carrying values and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.


### Legal Contingencies


For legal contingencies, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal fees and expenses are expensed as incurred. Note 8 provides additional information regarding our legal contingencies.


### Recent Accounting Pronouncements


In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2024-04, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments, which clarifies the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2025. The guidance is applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires public entities to provide a disclosure within the financial statement footnotes showing the disaggregation of certain expenses included in relevant expense captions on the consolidated income statement, with a qualitative description of the amounts that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. The guidance also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The guidance is applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities to provide greater disaggregation within their annual rate reconciliation, including new requirements to present reconciling items on a gross basis in specified categories, disclose both percentages and dollar amounts, and disaggregate individual reconciling items by jurisdiction and nature when the effect of the items meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance also requires disaggregating the annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds received, by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, with separate presentation of individual jurisdictions that

meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by this standard and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280 on an interim and annual basis, including new requirements to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within the reported measure(s) of a segment’s profit or loss, the amount and composition of any other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of a segment’s profit or loss to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, applied retrospectively with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-07. Refer to Note 19 of these consolidated financial statements.

The entire disclosure for the basis of presentation and significant accounting policies concepts. Basis of presentation describes the underlying basis used to prepare the financial statements (for example, US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Other Comprehensive Basis of Accounting, IFRS). Accounting policies describe all significant accounting policies of the reporting entity.

## SECTION: Revenue
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

We determine revenue recognition by first identifying the contract or contracts with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We determine collectability by performing ongoing credit evaluations and monitoring customer accounts receivable balances. Sales tax, including value added tax, is excluded from reported revenue.

We generate substantially all of our revenues by offering various advertising products on Snapchat, which include Snap Ads and AR Ads, referred to as advertising revenue. AR Ads include Sponsored Lenses, which allow users to interact with an advertiser’s brand by enabling branded augmented reality experiences.

The substantial majority of advertising revenue is generated from the display of advertisements on Snapchat through contractual agreements that are either based on the number of advertising impressions delivered or on a fixed fee basis over a period of time. Revenue related to agreements based on the number of impressions delivered is recognized when the advertisement is served. Revenue related to fixed fee arrangements is recognized ratably over the service period, typically less than 30 days in duration, and such arrangements do not contain minimum impression guarantees.

In arrangements where another party is involved in providing specified services to a customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal or agent. In this evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. For the periods presented, revenue for arrangements where we are the agent was not material.

We also generate revenue from subscriptions and sales of hardware products. Sales of hardware products are reported net of allowances for returns. For the periods presented, all such revenue was not material.

The following table represents our revenue disaggregated by geographic region based on the billing address of the customer:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) | 2022 - (in thousands) |

| Rest of world | 1,168,106 | 881,736 | 683,529 |
| **Total revenue** | **$5,361,398** | **$4,606,115** | **$4,601,847** |



(1)North America includes Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America.

(2)United States revenue was $3.1 billion, $2.9 billion, and $3.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

(3)Europe includes Russia and Turkey. Effective March 2022, we halted advertising sales to Russian and Belarusian entities.

The entire disclosure of revenue from contract with customer to transfer good or service and to transfer nonfinancial asset. Includes, but is not limited to, disaggregation of revenue, credit loss recognized from contract with customer, judgment and change in judgment related to contract with customer, and asset recognized from cost incurred to obtain or fulfill contract with customer. Excludes insurance and lease contracts.

## SECTION: Net Loss per Share
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

We compute net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock. We have three classes of authorized common stock for which voting rights differ by class.

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to each class of stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of stock outstanding during the period, adjusted for RSAs for which the risk of forfeiture has not yet lapsed.

For the calculation of diluted net loss per share, net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for basic net loss per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plans. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding. We use the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the convertible senior notes due in 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, and 2030 (collectively, the “Convertible Notes”) on diluted net loss per share. The Convertible Notes would have a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of Class A common stock for a given period exceeds the respective conversion price of the Convertible Notes. For the periods presented, our potentially dilutive shares relating to stock options, RSUs, RSAs, and Convertible Notes were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect of including these shares in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.

The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net loss per share computations for our common stock are calculated as follows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,

## SECTION: Stockholders' Equity
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024


### Common Stock


As of December 31, 2024, we are authorized to issue 3,000,000,000 shares of Class A non-voting common stock, 700,000,000 shares of Class B voting common stock, and 260,887,848 shares of Class C voting common stock, each with a par value of $0.00001 per share. Class A common stockholders have no voting rights, Class B common stockholders are entitled to one vote per share, and Class C common stockholders are entitled to ten votes per share. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Shares of our Class C common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class B common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class B common stock upon transfer. Any dividends paid to the holders of the Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock will be paid on a pro rata basis. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we did not declare any dividends. On a liquidation event, as defined in our certificate of incorporation, any distribution to common stockholders is made on a pro rata basis to the holders of the Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock.

As of December 31, 2024, there were 1,483,717,717 shares issued and 1,436,495,296 shares outstanding of Class A common stock, and 22,523,290 shares and 231,626,943 shares issued and outstanding of Class B common stock and Class C common stock, respectively.


### Stock-based Compensation Plans


We maintain one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). In January 2017, our board of directors adopted the 2017 Plan, and in February 2017, our stockholders approved the 2017 Plan, effective on March 1, 2017. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees,

including employees of any parent or subsidiary, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSUs, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other forms of stock awards to employees, directors, and consultants, including employees and consultants of our affiliates. The maximum term for stock options granted under the 2017 Plan may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. The 2017 Plan will terminate ten years from the date our board of directors approved the plan, unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors.

The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan will increase automatically on January 1st of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2018 through January 1, 2027, by the lesser of (i) 5.0% of the total number of shares of our capital stock outstanding on December 31st of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (ii) a number determined by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2024, there were 152,488,503 shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.

2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In January 2017, our board of directors adopted the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2017 ESPP”). Our stockholders approved the 2017 ESPP in February 2017. The 2017 ESPP became effective in connection with the IPO. A total of 16,484,690 shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2017 ESPP. No shares of our Class A common stock have been issued or offered under the 2017 ESPP. The number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase on January 1st of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2018 through January 1, 2027, by the lesser of (i) 1.0% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding on the last day of the calendar month before the date of the automatic increase, and (ii) 15,000,000 shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii). As of December 31, 2024, there were 16,484,690 shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 ESPP.

### Convertible Notes


2030 Notes

In May 2024, we entered into a purchase agreement with certain counterparties for the sale of an aggregate of $750.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The 2030 Notes consisted of a $650.0 million initial placement and an over-allotment option that provided the initial purchasers of the 2030 Notes with the option to purchase an additional $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2030 Notes, which was fully exercised. The 2030 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated May 13, 2024. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes were $671.5 million, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (“2030 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2030 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears beginning on November 1, 2024 at a rate of 0.50% per year. The 2030 Notes mature on May 1, 2030 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2030 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 45.0846 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2030 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $22.18 per share of our Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments for certain events as described in the indenture governing the 2030 Notes.

We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2030 Notes, at our option, on or after May 5, 2027 if (i) the 2030 Notes are “freely tradable” (as defined in the applicable indenture) and any accrued and unpaid additional interest has been paid as of the date we send the related redemption notice and (ii) the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

Holders of the 2030 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2030 Notes at their option prior to February 1, 2030, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, only under the following circumstances:

•if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2030 Notes on each such trading day;

•during the five consecutive business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2030 Notes for each day of that ten consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the 2030 Notes on such trading day;

•on a notice of redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, in which case we may be required to increase the conversion rate for the 2030 Notes so surrendered for conversion in connection with such redemption notice; or

•on the occurrence of specified corporate events.

On or after February 1, 2030, the 2030 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.

Holders of the 2030 Notes who convert the 2030 Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2030 Notes, or in connection with a redemption are entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the 2030 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the 2030 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 2030 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

We accounted for the issuance of the 2030 Notes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as no other embedded features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives.

2028 Notes

In February 2022, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of an aggregate of $1.50 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes were $1.31 billion, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (the “2028 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2028 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears beginning on September 1, 2022 at a rate of 0.125% per year. The 2028 Notes mature on March 1, 2028 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2028 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 17.7494 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2028 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $56.34 per share of our Class A common stock. Holders of the 2028 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2028 Notes at their option prior to December 1, 2027, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes. On or after December 1, 2027, the 2028 Notes are convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2028 Notes, at our option, on or after March 5, 2025 based on certain circumstances.

2027 Notes

In April 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of an aggregate of $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Notes were $1.05 billion, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (the “2027 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2027 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations which do not bear regular interest and for which the principal balance will not accrete. The 2027 Notes will mature on May 1, 2027 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

The 2027 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 11.2042 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $89.25 per share of our Class A common stock. Holders of the 2027 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2027 Notes at their option prior to February 1, 2027, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. On or after February 1, 2027, the 2027 Notes are convertible at any

time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. We may redeem for cash all or portions of the 2027 Notes, at our option, on or after May 5, 2024 based on certain circumstances.

2026 Notes

In August 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale of an aggregate of $1.265 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes were $1.15 billion, net of debt issuance costs and cash used to purchase the capped call transactions (the “2026 Capped Call Transactions”) discussed below. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The 2026 Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears beginning on February 1, 2020 at a rate of 0.75% per year. The 2026 Notes mature on August 1, 2026 unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted in accordance with the terms prior to such date.

Holders of the 2026 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2026 Notes at their option prior to May 1, 2016, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2026 Notes.

#### Note Repurchases


In February 2024, we entered into various privately negotiated repurchase transactions with certain holders of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase $100.0 million in aggregate principal of the 2025 Notes and $351.2 million in aggregate principal of the 2026 Notes for a cash repurchase price of $440.7 million, including associated costs. The February 2024 repurchase transactions resulted in an $8.8 million gain on extinguishment in the first quarter of 2024.

In May 2024, we entered into various privately negotiated repurchase transactions (collectively with the February 2024 repurchase transactions, the “Note Repurchases”) with certain holders of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase $147.9 million in aggregate principal of the 2025 Notes and approximately $237.5 million in aggregate principal of the 2026 Notes for a cash repurchase price of approximately $418.3 million, including associated costs. The May 2024 repurchase transactions were accounted for as both a debt modification and a partial debt

extinguishment, resulting in a $15.5 million loss on extinguishment during the second quarter of 2024 and $20.9 million in capitalized debt issuance costs amortized over the term of the 2030 Notes. The capitalized debt issuance costs are primarily related to repurchase premiums and debt issuance costs carried over from the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes.

Gains and losses on extinguishment are included within other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and included within Other as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Convertible Notes consisted of the following:

Each of the notes in the table above rank equally with each other. The effective interest rates for the 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2030 Notes range between 0.19% and 1.21%. As of December 31, 2024, the debt issuance costs on the 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, and 2030 Notes will be amortized over the remaining period of approximately 0.3 years, 1.6 years, 2.3 years, 3.2 years, and 5.3 years, respectively.

The following table summarizes interest expense related to the Convertible Notes:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) | 2022 - (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Contractual interest expense | $7,334 | $8,874 | $8,655 |
| Amortization of debt issuance costs | 8,906 | 6,880 | 6,543 |
| **Total interest expense** | **$16,240** | **$15,754** | **$15,198** |



As of December 31, 2024, the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes did not exceed the principal amount. The sale price for conversion was not satisfied as of December 31, 2024 for the Convertible Notes, and as a result, the Convertible Notes will not be eligible for optional conversion during the first quarter of 2025, other than the 2025 Notes, which are eligible for optional conversion on or after February 1, 2025. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire them periodically.


#### Capped Call Transactions


In connection with the pricing of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2028 Notes, and the 2030 Notes, we entered into the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, the 2026 Capped Call Transactions, the 2027 Capped Call Transactions, the 2028 Capped Call Transactions, and the 2030 Capped Call Transactions (collectively, the “Capped Call Transactions”), respectively, with certain counterparties at a net cost of $100.0 million, $102.1 million, $86.8 million, $177.0 million, and $68.9 million respectively. The cap price of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, the 2026 Capped Call Transactions, the 2027 Capped Call Transactions, the 2028 Capped Call Transactions, and the 2030 Capped Call Transactions is initially $32.12, $32.58, $121.02, $93.90, and $33.48 per share of our Class A common stock, respectively. All are subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Conditions that cause adjustments to the initial strike price of the Capped Call Transactions mirror conditions that result in corresponding adjustments for the Convertible Notes.

The Capped Call Transactions are intended to reduce potential dilution to holders of our Class A common stock beyond the conversion prices up to the cap prices on any conversion of the Convertible Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction of our additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets. The Capped Call Transactions will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.

In May 2024, we entered into agreements to terminate all of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, which resulted in $62.7 million recorded within additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2024, the remaining Capped Call Transactions were out-of-the-money.


### Credit Facility


In May 2022, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with certain lenders that allows us to borrow up to $1.05 billion to fund working capital and general corporate-purpose expenditures. Loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) a term secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 0.75% or the base rate, if selected by us, for loans made in U.S. dollars, (ii) the Sterling overnight index average plus 0.7826% for loans made in Sterling, or (iii) foreign indices as stated in the credit agreement plus 0.75% for loans made in other permitted foreign currencies. The base rate is defined as the greatest of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (ii) the greater of the (a) federal funds rate and (b) the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the applicable SOFR for a period of one month (but not less than zero) plus 1.00. The Credit Facility also contains an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. As of December 31, 2024, we had $80.7 million in the form of outstanding standby letters of credit, with no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.

## SECTION: Commitments and Contingencies
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024


### Commitments


We have non-cancelable contractual agreements primarily related to the hosting of our data processing, storage, and other computing services, as well as lease, content and developer partner, and other commitments. For additional discussion on leases, see Note 9 of these consolidated financial statements.

Our non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:


#### Table: Non-Cancelable Commitments
| label | (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: |
| Year ending December 31, |  |
| 2025 | $1,458,829 |
| 2026 | 1,835,591 |
| 2027 | 1,051,169 |
| 2028 | 87,229 |
| 2029 | 84,288 |
| Thereafter | 423,135 |
| **Total non-cancelable contractual commitments** | **$4,940,241** |




### Contingencies


We record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We also disclose material contingencies when we believe a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Accounting for contingencies requires us to use judgment related to both the likelihood of a loss and the estimate of the amount or range of loss. Many legal and tax contingencies can take years to be resolved.


#### Pending Matters


In November 2021, we, and certain of our officers and directors, were named as defendants in a securities class- action lawsuit purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our Class A common stock, alleging that we and certain of our officers made false or misleading statements and omissions concerning the impact that Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework would have on our business. We believe we have meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously. Based on the proceedings in this case, the outcome of this matter remains uncertain.

The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for a particular period. For the pending matter described above, it is not possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.

We are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including certain patent, trademark, privacy, regulatory, and employment matters. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, we do not believe that the final disposition of any of our other pending matters will seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.


### Indemnifications


In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, investors, directors, officers, employees, and other parties with respect to certain matters. Indemnification may include losses from our breach of such agreements, services we provide, or third-party intellectual property infringement claims. These indemnifications may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future indemnification payments may not be subject to a cap. We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnifications as of December 31, 2024. We believe the fair value of these liabilities is immaterial and accordingly have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2024.

The entire disclosure for commitments and contingencies.

## SECTION: Leases
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

We have non-cancelable lease agreements for certain of our offices with original lease terms expiring between 2025 and 2042. Total operating lease costs were $101.0 million, $101.0 million, and $109.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

The weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) and discount rate related to our operating leases were as follows:

As of December 31, 2024, we had additional operating leases that have not yet commenced for facilities with lease obligations of $19.7 million. These operating leases will commence starting in 2025 with lease terms of approximately 10 years to 11 years.

Cash payments included in the measurement of our operating lease liabilities, net of lease incentives received, were $101.4 million, $89.8 million, and $92.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Lease liabilities arising from obtaining operating lease right-of-use assets were $71.0 million, $220.2 million, and $147.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## SECTION: Strategic Investments
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

We hold strategic investments primarily in privately held companies, consisting primarily of equity securities without readily determinable fair values, and to a lesser extent, debt securities. These strategic investments are primarily recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The estimation of fair value for these privately held strategic investments requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, such as the issuance of new equity by the company, and as a result, we deem these assets as Level 3 financial instruments within the fair value measurement framework.

The following table summarizes our strategic investments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:


#### Table: As of December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Initial cost | $106,052 | $106,368 |

| Cumulative downward adjustments, including impairments | (63,910) | (58,357) |
| Carrying value | $188,343 | $195,328 |



Gains and losses recognized during the periods presented were as follows:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,

| Gains (losses) on strategic investments, net | $(7,429) | $(27,055) | $64,460 |



Gains and losses on all strategic investments are included within other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and included as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Strategic investments are included within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

## SECTION: Fair Value Measurements
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified into the following categories:

•Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

•Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.

We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market-based inputs to determine their fair value.

The following tables set forth our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding publicly traded equity securities, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:


#### Table: December 31, 2024

Gross unrealized losses on marketable debt securities were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we considered any decreases in fair value on our marketable debt securities to be driven by factors other than credit risk, including market risk. As of December 31, 2024, $1.1 billion of our total $2.3 billion in marketable debt securities have contractual maturities between one and five years. All other marketable debt securities have contractual maturities less than one year.

We hold investments in publicly traded companies with an aggregate carrying value of $12.4 million and $13.6 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, recorded as marketable securities. We classify these publicly traded equity securities within Level 1 because we use quoted market prices to determine their fair value. Gains and losses recognized during the periods presented, which are included within other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations, were as follows:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) | 2022 - (in thousands) |

We carry the Convertible Notes at face value less the unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets and present the fair value for disclosure purposes only. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2028 Notes, and the 2030 Notes was $35.5 million, $242.7 million, $998.5 million, $1,226.6 million, and $635.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2028 Notes was $300.9 million, $893.2 million, $921.5 million, and $1,181.7 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes, which are classified as Level 2 financial instruments, was determined based on the estimated or actual bid prices of the Convertible Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last business day of the period.

On December 20, 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, are currently proposing or have enacted legislation to implement core elements of the Pillar Two proposal. On February 1, 2023, the FASB indicated that they believe the minimum tax imposed under Pillar Two is an alternative minimum tax, and, accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the minimum tax would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated future effects of the minimum tax but would be recognized in the period incurred. We are closely monitoring developments and evaluating their potential impact. Enactments effective in 2024 did not have a significant impact on our

2024 financial results, nor do we anticipate a significant impact on our financial results during the transition period due to safe harbor relief.

As of December 31, 2024, we had an immaterial amount of unremitted earnings related to certain foreign subsidiaries. We intend to continue to reinvest these foreign earnings indefinitely and do not expect to incur any significant taxes related to such amounts.

As of December 31, 2024, we had accumulated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $6.1 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. During 2024, we fully utilized all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards generated before January 1, 2018, which were subject to a 20-year carryforward period and no taxable income limitation. The remaining $6.1 billion can be carried forward indefinitely but is subject to an 80% taxable income limitation. Certain significant state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2031. As of December 31, 2024, we had $4.7 billion of U.K. net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indefinitely; however, use of such carryforwards in a given year is generally limited to 50% of such year’s taxable income. As of December 31, 2024, we had accumulated $214.0 million of Singapore net operating loss carryforwards, which can be carried forward indefinitely and are not subject to any taxable income limitation. As of December 31, 2024, we had accumulated U.S. federal and state research tax credits of $916.5 million and $523.7 million, respectively. The U.S. federal research tax credits will begin to expire in 2032. The U.S. state research tax credits do not expire.

Beginning January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the option to currently deduct research and development expenditures in the period incurred and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenditures over five or fifteen years, as applicable, pursuant to Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code. In prior years, this tax law change did not result in any U.S. federal tax liability due to the availability of pre-2018 federal net operating loss carryforwards. However, as these pre-2018 carryforwards were fully utilized in 2024, the application of the 80% taxable income limitation on remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards resulted in incremental U.S. federal tax liability and expense for the year ended December 31, 2024. We continue to incur incremental state tax liability and expense due to limitations on the use of existing state net operating loss carryforwards.

We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We had valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets of $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2024, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a net increase in our deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations.


### Uncertain Tax Positions


The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:


#### Table: Year Ended December 31,
| label | 2024 - (in thousands) | 2023 - (in thousands) | 2022 - (in thousands) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits | $513,404 | $510,669 | $469,573 |
| Additions for current year tax positions | 49,536 | 46,188 | 47,366 |
| Additions for prior year tax positions | 1,163 | 10,171 | 115 |
| Reductions for prior year tax positions | (622) | (16,736) | (3,569) |
| Changes due to lapse of statute of limitations | (99) | (31,786) | (1,887) |
| Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities | — | (4,927) | — |
| Changes due to foreign currency translation adjustments | (574) | (175) | (929) |
| Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) | 562,808 | 513,404 | 510,669 |
| Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits | 1,918 | 967 | 385 |
| Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties) | $564,726 | $514,371 | $511,054 |



Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefit was recorded as a reduction in our gross deferred tax assets, offset by a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. We have net unrecognized tax benefits of $35.8 million and $27.3 million included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which, if recognized, would result in a tax benefit.

Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense recorded related to uncertain tax positions was not material.

The income taxes we pay are subject to potential review by taxing jurisdictions globally. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax position is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We believe that our estimate has adequately provided for these matters. However, our future results may include adjustments to estimates in the period the audits are resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate.

Employee Benefit Plans Employee Benefit Plans We have a defined contribution savings plan for U.S.-based employees under the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”). The 401(k) Plan is available for all full-time employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible employees may contribute up to 100% of their eligible compensation, but are limited to the maximum annual dollar amount allowable under the Code. We match 100% of each participant’s contribution up to a maximum of 3% of the participant’s eligible compensation paid during the period, and also match 50% of each participant’s contribution between 3% and 5% of the participant’s eligible compensation paid during the period. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized expense of $29.6 million, $34.0 million, and $33.6 million, respectively, related to matching contributions.

Related Party Transactions Related Party Transactions In November 2020, we entered into a ground sublease with an entity that is controlled by our CEO that allows us to build and operate a hangar to support our aviation program. This entity subleases the ground to us for $0 and in exchange may utilize a specified percentage of the hangar space. If the entity needs additional space within the hangar, it will pay rent to Snap at a fair market value rate determined at the time this arrangement was entered into. Any space utilized by this entity will be space that is not required for Snap’s aviation program. Subject to certain limited exceptions, neither party may terminate this sublease for at least six years. After this period, Snap or this entity may terminate the lease at any time on 24 months’ prior written notice. Upon termination of the sublease, this entity will purchase the hangar from Snap at its fair market value on the termination date. The value of these arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented or for the term of the agreement.

## SECTION: Segments and Geographic Information
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Dec. 31, 2024

Our CEO is our CODM. Our CODM evaluates performance and makes operating decisions about allocating resources based on financial data presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue disaggregated by geographic region. Because our CODM evaluates financial performance on a consolidated basis, we have determined that we have a single operating segment composed of the consolidated financial results of Snap Inc.

The measure used by our CODM to assess performance and make operating decisions is net loss as reported on our consolidated statements of operations. Net loss is used by our CODM to identify underlying trends in the performance of our business and make comparisons with the financial performance of our competitors. Our CODM also reviews total assets, as reported on our consolidated balance sheets, and purchases of property and equipment, as reported on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Our CODM also utilizes expense information in order to assess our financial performance. Infrastructure costs primarily consist of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products, which include expenses related to storage, computing, and bandwidth. Content and developer partner costs primarily consist of fees paid to our content creators and publisher partners who share content on our platform through revenue sharing arrangements. Advertising partner and other costs primarily consist of payments to third-party partners for fulfillment services, credit card and other transaction processing fees, and other expenses directly related to providing our services. Operating expenses include all remaining costs necessary to operate our business, which primarily include personnel expenses, facilities and related costs, promotional and marketing expenses, external professional services, and other administrative expenses. Operating expenses include charges recognized as research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations, but exclude stock-based compensation and related payroll and other tax expenses, depreciation and amortization, and restructuring charges, which are independently reviewed by our CODM.

The following table presents the significant segment expenses and other segment items regularly reviewed by our CODM:

## SECTION: Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy Disclosure
<!-- Source: XBRL -->
Cybersecurity Risk Management Processes for Assessing, Identifying, and Managing Threats [Text Block] Risk Management and Strategy Our engineering security team, led by our Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO, uses a multi-pronged approach to assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. This approach includes identifying and assessing risks through: (1) an enterprise risk management program, which is periodically refreshed and includes an identification of our top risks, including cybersecurity risks; (2) formalized security and privacy reviews designed to identify risks from many new features, software, and vendors; (3) a vulnerability management program designed to identify hardware and software vulnerabilities; (4) an internal “red team” program, which simulates cyber threats, intended to allow us to fix vulnerabilities before threat actors identify them; (5) a threat intelligence program designed to model and research our adversaries; and (6) a privacy and security incident response program designed to investigate, respond to, and remediate known incidents. These processes vary in scope and maturity across the business and are processes we work to improve. Our risk management approach is supplemented by external and internal enterprise risk management audits, which are designed to test the effectiveness of our controls. We conduct penetration testing or other application security testing on a periodic basis, and have established an external bug bounty program to allow security researchers to help identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in our controls and configurations in our systems. We also maintain a vendor risk management program designed to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with third-party suppliers and business partners. This program includes pre-engagement diligence, use of contractual cybersecurity and incident notification provisions, and ongoing monitoring of vendors, as appropriate. We also conduct employee training on data protection, including cybersecurity, among other topics. We use third-party service providers to assist us from time to time to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats, including for example professional service firms (including legal counsel), threat intelligence services, and cybersecurity consultants. The material cybersecurity threats identified through these processes are managed by our CISO and are escalated to senior management and our risk and compliance committee, in each case where appropriate. Together, they identify responsive actions for inclusion in our annual strategic planning, or earlier resolution depending on the nature of the risk. For a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially affect us and how they may do so, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Cybersecurity Risk Management Processes Integrated [Text Block] Our engineering security team, led by our Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO, uses a multi-pronged approach to assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. This approach includes identifying and assessing risks through: (1) an enterprise risk management program, which is periodically refreshed and includes an identification of our top risks, including cybersecurity risks; (2) formalized security and privacy reviews designed to identify risks from many new features, software, and vendors; (3) a vulnerability management program designed to identify hardware and software vulnerabilities; (4) an internal “red team” program, which simulates cyber threats, intended to allow us to fix vulnerabilities before threat actors identify them; (5) a threat intelligence program designed to model and research our adversaries; and (6) a privacy and security incident response program designed to investigate, respond to, and remediate known incidents.

Cybersecurity Risk Board of Directors Oversight [Text Block] Governance Our board of directors maintains oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats by meeting with and receiving periodic updates from our CISO, via our audit committee, which is assigned oversight of cybersecurity risks. In addition, the chair of our audit committee meets with our CISO periodically to discuss cybersecurity threats and incidents, as well as the business’s approach to responding to them. Our incident response plans also provide that our board of directors and audit committee will be notified in the event of certain cybersecurity incidents. Our CISO, Jim Higgins, has over 30 years of experience in the technology sector, including senior leadership roles in product security, information security engineering, and cloud enterprise. Mr. Higgins assisted the Linux Foundation in starting the Open Source Security Foundation to help increase awareness and promote technical solutions to address validation of Open Source software. Mr. Higgins has worked in information security at Chevron, Eastman Kodak, and Google, and, mostly recently, spent two years as the CISO of Block, Inc. (formerly Square). Our CISO also regularly meets with our CEO and other senior management, including as part of the cybersecurity incident response process. Our CISO, and where appropriate our management team and risk and compliance committee, are informed about and monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of identified cybersecurity incidents, through our security incident response process. We maintain internal and external channels and signals to receive reports of cybersecurity or privacy threats or incidents. A reported incident triggers our Security Incident Response Policy or associated plans, which has defined roles for our cross-functional incident response team to investigate, contain, eradicate, and remediate the incident. The incident response team assesses the severity and priority of reported incidents on a rolling basis, with escalations of cybersecurity incidents provided to our management team by our CISO and General Counsel (or their designees) and escalations of certain cybersecurity incidents as appropriate to our board of directors. If a cybersecurity incident is determined to be a material cybersecurity incident, our Security Incident Response Policy and associated plans define the process to file a report regarding the incident with the SEC.
