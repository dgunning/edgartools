Item 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

We are an innovative digital health business transforming care through a unique combination of portable, semiconductor-based ultrasound technology, intuitive software, services and educational offerings that can make medical imaging more accessible than ever before. Due to its one-of-a-kind Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology, Butterfly’s solution enables the practical application of ultrasound information into the clinical workflow through affordable hardware that fits in a healthcare professional’s pocket and is paired with cloud-connected software that is easily accessed through a mobile application. 

While Butterfly is in the point-of-care ultrasound (“POCUS”) category, our technology is fundamentally different from incumbent POCUS devices, which we view as mere extensions of cart-based hospital workflows. In contrast, Butterfly is designed for true mobility, not just because it is a single, portable imaging device suitable for any doctor, nurse, and eventually, qualified chronic care patient, but also because it is powered by AI-driven tools, cloud connectivity, and seamless hospital integration. This combination of advanced, cloud-connected software and portable hardware is the key to mobility, allowing Butterfly to support large health systems while also functioning independently of them in remote or resource-limited settings. Wherever a doctor, nurse, or patient braves to go, Butterfly delivers imaging that adapts to their environment and remains securely connected.

With this proprietary, comprehensive portable ultrasound solution, that is protected by a robust intellectual property portfolio, we are on a mission to democratize healthcare by increasing access and use of ultrasound information wherever care is being delivered – whether a large healthcare system, a rural clinic, a global conflict zone or beyond. We are helping streamline and optimize deployment of ultrasound at scale across hospital systems with our Compass™ software that integrates into health system infrastructures, and connects across all departments and specialties. Furthermore, we envision a future where Butterfly’s imaging technology is fully integrated into hospital-at-home workflows, improving remote monitoring and management of patients’ health conditions from the comfort of their homes.

We market and sell the Butterfly solution to healthcare systems, as well as to physicians and healthcare providers through a direct sales force, distributors, and our eCommerce channel. We generated total revenue of $82.1 million and $65.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We also incurred net losses of $72.5 million and $133.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We employ approximately 190 employees as of January 31, 2025 and sell our products in over 30 countries through our sales force and independent distributors and directly to physicians through our eCommerce channel. Outside of our core commercial geographies, Butterfly iQ+ is also being utilized in over 70 low resource settings around the world through global health partnerships. Butterfly iQ3 is currently FDA-cleared for sale in the United States and CE marked in Europe. 

Corporate History and Information

The Company, formerly known as Longview Acquisition Corp. (“Longview”), was incorporated in Delaware in 2020 as a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Longview and Butterfly Network, Inc. (“Legacy Butterfly”), which was founded in 2011, completed a business combination (the “Business Combination”) on February 12, 2021, following which Longview was renamed Butterfly Network, Inc., and the business of Legacy Butterfly became our business.

Since our founding, Butterfly and our disruptive technology has been recognized by Prix Galien USA, Fierce50, TIME’s Best Inventions, Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas, CNBC Disruptor 50, and MedTech Breakthrough Awards, among other accolades.

The Evolution of Ultrasound

Digital health is systematically changing the way healthcare practitioners deliver care by providing information that informs better decision-making, while increasing access and significantly reducing patient-care costs. Butterfly devices are designed for this new wave of medical care with an easy-to-use interface that displays ultrasound information on your smartphone or tablet in real-time. 

Historically, the global ultrasound market has been dominated by traditional cart-based devices. These devices are accessible only to highly specialized, highly trained technicians and are located predominantly in hospitals, imaging centers, and physicians’ offices. Many healthcare institutions throughout the world lack the facilities and capital necessary to acquire and maintain expensive cart-based devices and cannot afford the highly trained individuals required to operate them. 

Traditional cart-based equipment typically ranges from $30,000 to $120,000 or more per new device, plus specialized labor. More recently, we have seen the introduction of POCUS and handheld devices with an average price point of $10,000, based on $3,000 to $7,000 per probe, with some requiring three or more probes to cover a comparable range of cleared indications to the single Butterfly probe, and those devices often require an upfront software investment for access to advanced imaging modes (e.g. pulsed-wave Doppler) and workflow (e.g. cloud storage) that can reach upwards of $2,000. Further, these incumbent POCUS devices operate off the same 60-year-old, analog piezoelectric crystal technology as traditional cart-based ultrasound, which we believe limits the opportunity for future progress. Further, most piezoelectric crystals that are utilized in these incumbent ultrasound devices contain lead at levels deemed hazardous by regulators. In fact, the lead included in many traditional piezoelectric crystal ultrasound systems exceeds the allowable amount of lead under the EU’s Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive (“RoHS”), requiring many of our competitors to rely upon an exemption to RoHS specifically permitting lead in single crystal piezoelectric materials for ultrasound transducers in order to commercialize their products in the EU. In contrast, Butterfly’s Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology allows us to offer much more versatile imaging capabilities on just one affordable probe without exceeding these limitations.

We believe the transition from traditional piezoelectric crystal sensors to semiconductor chip in ultrasound also gives us a competitive advantage because it allows our devices to benefit from Moore’s Law. Moore’s Law is a guiding principle of the semiconductor industry that states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every two years – meaning the computer processing power of a chip doubles every two years with minimal rise in cost. Much like the photography industry, when the digital camera’s image quality became equal to that of analog cameras, digital took over because it brought many other benefits – such as affordability, miniaturization, and advanced features for ease of use. Butterfly is on a path to driving that same transformation for the ultrasound industry toward more versatile, smaller, and consumer-friendly form factors.

Today, regulations still require a trained healthcare practitioner to operate our devices, but we are developing a technology roadmap to make it easier for users of all skill levels to use the device. We are focused on increasing the use of imaging during preventive care with the aim of providing the right information earlier in the care process for better, more rapid clinical decision making. As we continue to educate and empower ease-of-use, we believe that adoption of ultrasound information as a clinical assessment tool will grow and, in time, we will change the paradigm of care delivery. We believe that this information delivered through imaging with an intuitive user interface will further drive costs down and expand the use of imaging at clinical point-of-care.

Changing standards of care doesn't happen overnight, but our goal is to make this change happen much faster. We believe AI integration will be one key to accelerating the transition to handheld ultrasound, as it enables ease of use and automation, thereby removing barriers to adoption. To accelerate this process, we maintain an AI partnership ecosystem, Butterfly Garden™, that opens our software development kit (“SDK”) so third-party companies and developers can build and deploy new AI applications on our imaging platform, reaching our large installed base. For Butterfly, this model allows us to continue to broaden our base. As each of these companies develop on our platform, we believe we will have more of their customers buying Butterfly, while existing Butterfly customers will have access to even more capabilities.

We are also committed to accelerating adoption of POCUS through clinical education, not only by empowering the next generation of medical professionals with ultrasound skills and clinical integration knowledge via probe and software sale into medical schools for use in curriculum, but through our innovative collection of educational services and offerings.

Market Opportunity

We are on a journey to address a potential new market that we estimate exceeds $100 billion. We believe our solution addresses an unmet need across an addressable market of over 40 million healthcare practitioners, including approximately 10 million medical doctors, 30 million nurses and midwives, and 2 million veterinarians and veterinary technicians worldwide. Ultimately, our north star is to reach patients in alternative and home care settings, potentially with future, differentiated form factors intended to enable ease of use in the home, subject to receipt of required marketing authorizations.

In the near term, we are first driving adoption with healthcare practitioners, including doctors and nurses in healthcare systems and a focused group of initial customers in the veterinary market, comprised of companion animal, mixed animal, equine veterinarians, and veterinary academic institutions. Our newest Butterfly iQ3 device has demonstrated impressive uptake since its release in February 2024, driving further penetration into the market, with best-in-class image quality that has brought more ultrasound users over to Butterfly. As we look ahead, we will leverage the quality of Butterfly iQ3 and benefits of our Compass™ enterprise software to continue our focus on driving and expanding further into the hospital segment.

With our advanced digital capabilities made possible by our proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology, we believe we can not only address this market, but move beyond the restrictions of the existing ultrasound market. Our affordable holistic solution provides valuable clinical information and workflow efficiency that is attractive to any healthcare systems that seek to improve care at lower cost. These attributes also may allow the use of our Butterfly devices beyond traditional health system environments to where health systems look to evolve, such as the home. 

The advantages of our Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology align with recent industry trends, including the shift to outside-the-hospital or in-home medical care, affordability, harnessing of AI and deep learning, collaboration through the cloud, disruptive medical innovation, and increasing access to care. In addition, by expanding the settings in which medical imaging can be done, the Butterfly device may provide opportunities for earlier detection and prevention of disease, while reducing cost. This aligns with the focus on consumer health empowerment, wellness, and acceleration of value-based care, all of which are important themes in the healthcare industry today.

Business Strategy

We believe that, with our current products and solutions, we have created a new standard for medical imaging, and we are focused on staying at the leading edge of technical innovation. We believe our current portfolio is only the first step in our development and we plan to continually improve it and expand our product and service offerings. We have a strong leadership team with disruptive healthcare and commercial expertise that energized and reoriented the organization in 2024. Under this leadership, we have established a focused path by:

•Nurturing and growing our core capabilities and clinical pathways.

•Capturing new and adjacent markets.

•Leveraging our Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology into non-competitive markets through partnerships.

•Optimizing our resources.

As we execute on these strategies, Butterfly has become a more efficient business while simultaneously investing in long-term growth and innovation. Importantly, our expense reduction and cash preservation activities were paired with a continued commitment to increased productivity and efficiency. Because Butterfly devices are mobile and easy-to-use, healthcare practitioners can have access to ultrasound information outside of traditional settings. We continue to focus on the utility of our devices in global health contexts, including for building sustainable healthcare models in the developing world and for responding to natural and man-made humanitarian crises. For example, thousands of Butterfly devices have been distributed throughout the Ukraine, Gaza, and Israel via over 40 global health partnerships to support combat medics on the frontlines. We also remain committed to developing patient-focused delivery models, and we believe ultrasound imaging may find a market in home care settings with at-home medical personnel. These modalities have the potential to improve health outcomes, while avoiding expensive treatments, therefore generating economic value for both the patient 

page 8


and payor, which is aligned with the healthcare mega-trend of value-based care. In March 2024, we introduced our Butterfly HomeCare Services Business, which strives to support caregivers with patient management outside the hospital for certain chronic conditions. In January 2025, Butterfly initiated its first pilot program for virtual chronic care management services with a major at-risk Medicare Advantage provider in the United States. The goal is to reduce readmissions of their congestive heart failure patient population through frequent AI-powered imaging. If successful, it will be our first foray into a services model.

Future phases of the HomeCare Services Business envision use of wearable devices and patient-performed scanning – all subject to appropriate regulatory approvals and authorizations. As our future devices one day reach new markets and enable more direct interaction with patients (e.g., remote patient monitoring), we believe this trend can accelerate, further improving outcomes and reducing costs. This reduction of costs has the potential to create economic value for the whole healthcare system across clinical applications and markets where ultrasound scanning is used. We will work diligently to validate target at-home applications through focused clinical trials and will seek additional regulatory authorizations, as needed.

Products

Our current product portfolio includes a combination of hardware and software, including Butterfly iQ3, Butterfly iQ+, Butterfly iQ+ Bladder, and Butterfly iQ+ Vet devices, software subscriptions, and professional services. We offer cloud-based software solutions to healthcare systems, teleguidance, in-app educational tutorials as well as our ScanLab™ education-only app, formal education programs through our Butterfly Academy™ software and Butterfly Certified™ courses, as well as professional services for large scale deployments.

Butterfly iQ+ and iQ3

In 2018, Legacy Butterfly commercially launched Butterfly iQ, the world’s first handheld, single-probe, whole-body ultrasound system using semiconductor technology. The company has continued to innovate, leveraging the benefits of Moore’s Law, to launch its second generation Butterfly iQ+ in 2020 and third generation iQ3 in 2024 – each with increased processing power and performance enhancements. We have over 145,000 unique Butterfly users to date. 

Butterfly has two portable ultrasound devices on the market: our second-generation Butterfly iQ+ and third-generation Butterfly iQ3. Butterfly iQ+/iQ3 are both powered by our Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology, allowing them to power whole-body imaging on a single handheld probe using digital semiconductor technology. Both of these small, handheld devices are priced competitively compared to incumbent, piezoelectric crystal-based ultrasound handhelds and carts. Butterfly iQ+ is our most affordable whole-body scanner offered, listed at approximately $2,700. Butterfly iQ3 – powered by our most advanced P4.3 chip which has double the processing power for best-in-class image quality, new advanced 3D imaging tools for easier use, and a smaller, more ergonomic design – is valued higher at approximately $3,900 per device, but still remains one of the lowest-cost handheld ultrasound devices on the market. Both of our devices are incredibly versatile, allowing providers to access over 20 anatomical presets, 6 imaging modes, and a suite of AI and other calculation tools via Butterfly’s simple mobile application interface, the availability of which are often dependent upon local marketing clearances and therefore availability may differ by country. Our software is designed to make the product easy to use and fully integrated with the clinical workflow, accessible on a user’s smartphone, tablet, and almost any hospital computer system connected to the Internet.

Our Butterfly iQ+/iQ3 devices connect directly to a compatible iPhone or Android smartphone or tablet to provide their imaging and software features for approximately two consecutive hours, according to average use as determined from field data analytics. Under normal conditions, the Butterfly iQ3 charges to full battery in two hours, and the Butterfly iQ+ in approximately five hours. The devices have over 20 ready-to-use anatomical presets generated in part with AI that are designed to optimize images obtained from scanning different areas of the body. Within the Butterfly application, users can utilize up to six imaging modes, including B-Mode, Color Doppler, M-Mode, Power Doppler, Pulsed-Wave Doppler, and Biplane Imaging™, as well as advanced tools iQ Slice™ and iQ Fan™. 

In addition, advanced measuring tools can be used for a variety of specialties, including nursing and obstetrics. These features allow healthcare practitioners to perform surface area and volume measurements on the anatomical objects that are imaged and can use color Doppler to identify movement of fluid, similar to features provided by legacy products in the market. 

•For obstetric clinicians, our devices’ tools can perform gestational age and amniotic fluid index calculations. 

page 9


•The devices’ tools can provide automated bladder volume calculations with 3D visualizations, enable easier line placements using NeedleViz™ technology and Biplane Imaging™, or produce a B-line count (an indicator of wetness in the lungs) from just a six second ultrasound clip using the Auto B-line Counter.

•Using TeleGuidance™, healthcare practitioners can perform ultrasound remotely, providing real-time guidance by connecting with a novice user or peer directly from the Butterfly app. Through our TeleGuidance™ feature, healthcare practitioners can control the settings of the application while the device is in use and help the user identify the image.

•On the Butterfly iQ3, users can also access new automated image capture modes: iQ Slice™ and iQ Fan™. iQ Slice™ automatically steers the beam to scan an organ and capture up to 46 ultrasound slices at a time across a wide angle. iQ Fan™ is a dedicated lung tool that further builds on the core iQ Slice technology to allow providers to benefit from real-time, back-and-forth virtual fanning, making it easier to visualize A-lines and other lung conditions.

We believe these pre-set settings and intuitive operation features through smartphones will enable healthcare practitioners to adopt our devices, expanding our user base beyond the traditional ultrasound user base. This traditional base of ultrasound users has been limited because existing ultrasound devices often require unique environments and extensive training to operate, while the Butterfly devices were designed to be used by general and other healthcare practitioners across the healthcare industry.

Butterfly devices consist of both durable hardware and dynamic software solutions designed to make ultrasound imaging accessible to all healthcare practitioners, including nurses. We also sell accessories for our devices including cases, adaptors, and carts.

Software Subscriptions

We believe that the software and analytics capabilities of our solution, coupled with the Butterfly devices, empower smarter and expanded scanning, quality assurance, credentialing, documentation, and billing that can generate incremental revenue for both healthcare systems and independent practitioners but also reduce costs for payers from earlier detection and prevention of adverse downstream events due to suboptimal care decisions or treatment complications. 

We currently offer different software membership plans, including Core Technology, our base software membership for individual users that is priced at approximately $300 per year, and Advanced Technology, our complete ultrasound solution for individual users that is priced at approximately $420 per year. In addition, we offer other membership plans that are specific to customer needs, including iQ+ Care for bladder scanner and vascular access application solutions, integrated software enterprise solutions to enable ultrasound deployments at scale, and medical education subscriptions for universities. 

Through our software subscription options, users can upload scanned images to our HIPAA-compliant cloud, which has unlimited storage and links to electronic medical records (“EMRs”) on hospital and office systems, allowing for seamless transfer of images that can also be accessed from a desktop computer. 

Butterfly iQ+ Bladder

In May 2024, we introduced our first specialty product, iQ+ Bladder, in the United States. With iQ+ Bladder, we expand outside of our core point-of-care ultrasound market to better serve the bladder scanning market with our proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology. The bundled bladder solution includes an iQ+ Bladder probe, streamlined software, compact rolling cart, tablet, and power splitter, paired with premium assembly.

The rolling cart features storage space and a probe charging dock for enhanced convenience and readiness, and a large tablet is mounted to the cart with tilted brackets that rotate 360° and pan 180° for optimum viewing and positioning. The probe is paired with streamlined software, designed to address the specific needs of nurses and other providers who regularly conduct bladder scans. The application has a user-friendly interface, with no login or configurations necessary, allowing for immediate access to quick and intuitive scans. To empower confident, accurate measurement, the solution offers walkthrough guidance for proper probe placement, and it also leverages Butterfly’s advanced bladder visualization capabilities, including 3D rendering to confirm true bladder anatomy.

Butterfly for Enterprises

In 2022, we introduced an updated system-wide platform designed to support the scaled integration and deployment of our ultrasound hardware and Compass™ software across hospitals and health systems to empower image-informed clinical decisions from the bedside and encounter-based workflow. Leveraging Butterfly’s unique combination of a whole-body handheld ultrasound device, software, and services, our enterprise platform supports hospitals and health systems with a complete ultrasound solution. This system-wide offering promotes improved patient care via accessible imaging across multiple disciplines and care settings. Our device-agnostic software securely integrates into health systems’ clinical and administrative systems and workflows (e.g., Picture Archiving and Communication System (“PACS”) and EMR), including with non-Butterfly devices. 

The Butterfly enterprise platform is built for organizations, including hospital systems, medical schools and residency programs. With this platform, institutions can rapidly and easily access ultrasound-enabled insights and oversight of their entire ultrasound program on one streamlined software solution. Benefits include, but are not limited to:

•Streamlined documentation & QA workflows,

•Increased billable exams,

•Centralized governance and program management, 

•Cloud storage access,

•Ensured interoperability, and

•Education, proficiency, and credentialing management.

Educational Tools

In January 2024, ScanLab™ went live in the Apple App Store. Our AI-powered, educational ScanLab™ app provides written walkthroughs and reference imagery to guide real-time educational scanning. Enhancing the learning process are AI image quality indicators that provide real-time feedback for image adjustment and interactive AI labeling to help learners locate key anatomy. 

Our platform features education tools to enable users to quickly gain proficiency in conducting exams, including hundreds of educational videos taught by experts. In 2023, we launched Butterfly Certified™, a complete set of virtual and in-person POCUS courses designed to provide practitioners with the skillsets necessary to meet local training or privileging requirements, delivered in collaboration with the Global Ultrasound Institute (“GUSI”). The hands-on training packages, which are expert-led and include tailored tracks across specialties that can be scaled for individual or department use, are available in the United States through direct Butterfly sales representatives. In 2021, we launched Butterfly Academy™, which provides embedded education and training to enable clinicians across care settings, to support long-term scaling of Butterfly throughout a healthcare system and for use in medical education applications.

Butterfly iQ+ Vet

In 2021, we launched Butterfly iQ+ Vet, a handheld ultrasound system that leverages the technology developed for our other iQ devices and is designed to bring value to veterinarians in a variety of care settings, helping to usher in a new standard for veterinary medicine.

As of December 31, 2024, iQ+ Vet is available in approximately 20 international markets, bringing first-of-its-kind innovation to veterinarians. The product includes a specially designed animal-specific probe for ease of use and maneuvering, Color-Doppler, and NeedleViz. We are changing the way that veterinarians deliver care, providing more information through imaging at the point-of-care, particularly since their patients do not speak.

When Butterfly launched its Auto B-Line Counter for human care in 2023, our Vet business saw an opportunity to use it in production cattle. There are one million cattle producers in the U.S. alone. They often prophylactically give their cattle expensive antibiotics to control disease spread and protect their herds. Our device has now been validated through publications affirming its utility in earlier detection of bovine respiratory disease to reduce antibiotic use – which could ultimately save time and money and has implications for supporting more sustainable upkeep of our cattle food supply.

Marketing and Sales

We market our products worldwide, in the U.S. through our targeted sales organization and internationally through both our direct sales force and our distributors. In the U.S., our sales organization is engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily to healthcare institutions through direct sales and distributor partnerships. In the United States, Butterfly has been purchased by a clinician in most of the 100 largest healthcare systems. We use a variety of marketing tools to drive adoption, foster continued usage, and establish brand loyalty for our devices and software. We recognize the importance of the role of education in accelerating adoption of our products by those medical professionals without existing ultrasound skills.

We sell through three main channels:

•A targeted, regional, direct sales force focused on large healthcare system-wide implementations. 

•An eCommerce website through which we sell our Butterfly devices to healthcare practitioners and veterinarians in these geographies, where allowed by local law.

•Distributor, veterinary, and affiliate relationships to unlock additional channels to supplement our direct and eCommerce sales. 

Because healthcare institutions often make decisions to purchase on a system-wide level, we believe enterprise sales can generate economies of scale with larger volumes and larger numbers of users, while also increasing user retention. The health system channel also yields more comprehensive software subscriptions, which further increases our revenue from devices and subscriptions sold. We are working towards increasingly integrated solutions to maximize our value to large healthcare customers, as well as continuing to improve our sales and support infrastructure. Our ability to connect and integrate with traditional third-party ultrasound systems gives enterprise customers a solution to the governance and workflow challenges that may have previously limited the utilization and billing of point of care imaging devices. Health system customers deploying our solution can benefit from a streamlined clinical workflow that reduces the exam documentation burden typically associated with traditional ultrasound systems. By adopting Butterfly’s enterprise solution, customers can responsibly manage and optimize value from their fleets of point of care imaging devices.

Our international sales organization is focused on expanding access to innovative ultrasound technology through a strategic mix of direct sales, distribution partnerships, and e-commerce. We continue to refine our global go-to-market approach by optimizing our distribution network, investing in partner training, and ensuring regulatory compliance in key markets. Our international growth strategy prioritizes market expansion, healthcare provider education, and commercial execution, driving increased adoption across diverse healthcare ecosystems worldwide. We sell directly in Germany and the United Kingdom, and, through our distribution partnerships and e-commerce platform, our commercial footprint extends to approximately 40 countries.

We continue to develop our sales and marketing organization, which consists of a dedicated sales team, sales operations and sales support personnel that are complemented by a marketing team. As of January 31, 2025, we had approximately 60 people employed globally in sales, sales support, and marketing.

Geographic Areas

Butterfly is being used in over 100 countries. Outside of our core commercial geographies, Butterfly is also being utilized through collaborations with non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) like the Gates Foundation to deliver our technology to underserved communities. Currently, we have placed our device with hundreds of NGOs, entities, and healthcare professionals that align with our mission to deliver care around the world and bring potentially lifesaving medical imaging to patients, often for the first time.

POCUS capabilities have been commercially available for decades, yet adoption in low-and-middle income countries is minimal. Butterfly’s global health program seeks to upend that paradigm by leveraging our technology to democratize medical imaging for marginalized and vulnerable populations around the world. In 2024, we completed the second phase of the world’s largest rapid POCUS deployment to sub-Saharan Africa, funded by a $5 million grant from the Gates Foundation. The initiative has brought 1,000 Butterfly iQ+ probes and ultrasound training to a region of the world that has 

page 12


disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality. Preliminary findings from the first phase of deployment in Kenya demonstrate, among other findings, that:

•95% of the participant providers in Kenya are now using Butterfly to detect high-risk conditions and inform treatment decisions.

•80% of the participant providers have trained at least 2 other providers at their hospital to drive further wide scale use. 

•80% of surveyed mothers reported experiencing happiness upon seeing their baby on screen.

We see our work in the areas of maternal and fetal health as the building blocks for continued impact toward better clinical assessment overall, and we believe our model is applicable to many more geographies and specialties. We anticipate leveraging our work in sub-Saharan Africa to continue improving access to imaging in other limited resource settings, and we aim to further expand our international customer base in the future. 

In terms of geographic markets, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, a substantial majority of our revenues were derived from sales to customers based in the United States. We believe our differentiated Butterfly handheld device and our growing user base of Butterfly practitioners, with sales to or agreements with most of the largest 100 U.S. healthcare systems and devices deployed across approximately 100 countries, position us well to compete in the existing ultrasound market and to potentially expand into emerging markets.

Research and Development

We plan to develop future applications, subject to appropriate marketing authorization, to leverage our unique hardware foundation and commitment to improving our software using AI. Simultaneously, we plan to enhance our software capabilities, pursuing regulatory authorizations as necessary, with new features to support clinical procedures. We also plan to further enhance workflow automations for our Compass™ software, in order to more deeply integrate our platform with healthcare systems, as we work with these customers to deploy Butterfly in their organizations. 

In this way, we expect our solution will continue to innovate naturally, as well as through our enhancements to our proprietary technology. In order to pave the way for future phases of our HomeCare Services Business, we anticipate we will need to validate the at-home applications through focused clinical trials and also seek additional regulatory authorizations.

We believe these hardware developments, along with our software enhancements and user education initiatives, will bring ultrasound to even more healthcare systems and healthcare practitioners. We believe that with our differentiated and continually expanding solution, we have the potential to drive user adoption and change clinical behavior.

Beyond these hardware and software product roadmaps, we plan to develop new innovative products, services, and software applications in partnership with healthcare systems, leveraging our core technology and platform capabilities. Through this product development, we believe we will be positioned to remain on the forefront of medical imaging with a continued focus on both enabling access to more information at low cost and reduced effort and allowing us to enable healthcare practitioners to transform care with Butterfly through our education offerings, an intuitive interface, and AI that unlock the power of point-of-care information quickly and confidently.

Reimbursement

While we do not bill health plans directly, practitioners can leverage pre-existing, routine Current Procedural Terminology® codes (“CPT codes”) that enable them to obtain per-scan reimbursement in the specialties of anesthesiology, cardiology, critical care, emergency medicine, endocrinology, and ultrasound-guided procedures.

Competition

Several large companies currently constitute the bulk of ultrasound sales. High regulatory, distribution, manufacturing, and service-related long-term contractual costs represent significant barriers to entry for any new player. We expect that the existing market participants will remain strong active players in the future.

As a general matter, we view competition on two levels:

page 13


•Conventional ultrasound systems; and

•The development of other handheld ultrasound systems with the same or better attributes.

The primary competition comes from established market participants offering conventional ultrasound systems. While Butterfly's target is often non-traditional ultrasound users, we do compete with both traditional ultrasound manufacturers and other handheld ultrasound systems. However, Butterfly’s semiconductor technology differentiates us from our competitors in many ways, including the fact that our probes do not rely upon lead-based piezoelectric crystals that many of our competitors have relied upon since inception. Our semiconductor technology similarly enables a more versatile probe capable of performing whole-body scans, which is generally not possible with handheld ultrasound systems that rely upon piezoelectric crystals. Furthermore, Butterfly’s lack of reliance upon lead piezoelectric crystals allows us to remain RoHS-compliant in the EU without the use of the exemption from RoHS requirements for lead in single crystal piezoelectric materials in ultrasound transducers — an exemption that is not guaranteed to continue in perpetuity and that, as of October 2024, Butterfly has formally submitted a request to revoke to the European Commission.

Human Capital Resources

Our employees embody our mission to democratize healthcare and to make medical imaging accessible to everyone around the world by using our proprietary technology. We are committed to growing and cultivating an environment that values the diverse perspectives, backgrounds, experiences, and geographies of our employees and other stakeholders. We believe that our people are the reason for our success, and we have organized ourselves to maximize productivity and performance. We maintain a high bar for talent and actively work to build diversity within our workforce. 

Demographics. As of January 31, 2025, we had approximately 190 employees. As of January 31, 2025, approximately 165 of our employees were located in the United States and approximately 25 of our employees were located outside the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We supplement our employee population with independent contractors, contingent workers and temporary workforce support as needed. In July 2024, we entered into an agreement with a third-party global technology and business transformation partner to optimize and lower the cost of certain non-specialized technical functions. As part of the transition into this new partnership, a portion of the Company's workforce will be in lower-cost geographies.

Total Rewards. To attract qualified applicants to Butterfly and retain our employees, we offer a competitive total rewards package for all employees, consisting of market-competitive base salaries, annual target cash bonuses that recognize and reward company performance as well as individual results, long-term equity incentives that encourage our employees to focus on long-term value creation, and other comprehensive benefits, such as a 401(k) plan with employer matching and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

Employee Health. Aligned with our mission to make healthcare more accessible, we believe our employees should not have to worry about their health care costs. Butterfly offers employees medical, dental, and vision coverage that is covered at 100%, and we provide an employer-funded health savings account for out-of-pocket expenses. Our coverage encompasses mental, physical, and emotional well-being through our employee assistance program, which provides emotional support, work-life solutions, and other personal guidance resources. We are also focused on ensuring all of our employees, as well as temporary contractors and visitors to our sites, can work safely.

Manufacturing

Our Butterfly devices are built using both custom-made and off-the-shelf components supplied by vendors and contract manufacturers. The key custom-made component in the Butterfly probe is the ultrasound transducer module consisting of a custom micro-electro-mechanical systems ultrasound semiconductor chip and lens which are manufactured in Taiwan and then sent to Thailand for assembly.

We purchase some of our components and materials used in manufacturing, including the transducer module, from single sources. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement components, which could negatively affect our ability to supply our products on a timely basis. We cannot give assurances that any alternative supplier would be able to recreate the manufacturing processes currently in use. To mitigate this risk, we typically carry a significant inventory of critical components.

Many of our Butterfly probes are manufactured, tested and shipped by Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (“Benchmark”) from its facilities in Thailand. We believe that this manufacturing strategy and supply chain is efficient and conserves capital.

However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer for our Butterfly products, we would experience additional costs and difficulties in doing so.

Key Agreements

Foundry Service Agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

We entered into a Foundry Service Agreement (the “FSA”) with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”) in March 2019, as amended on October 1, 2020, under which TSMC agreed to manufacture integrated circuits used for the semiconductor chips in our probes. The FSA allows us to place purchase orders with TSMC, which are not binding until accepted by TSMC. The FSA also provides for TSMC to use commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture our products at TSMC and for us to meet monthly minimum purchase obligations. Under the FSA, we prepaid an amount to TSMC to be used against a portion of the purchase price for future purchases once the prepayment amount is reached. To the extent that we fail to fulfill our monthly wafer consumption requirement, TSMC has the right to deduct the shortfall from payments made by us to TSMC. In addition, we are required to buy back from TSMC unused raw wafers that TSMC purchases from its supplier.

The FSA also provides that TSMC will indemnify us for intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims against us related to the wafer manufacturing process and that we will indemnify TSMC for any intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims arising from TSMC’s compliance with our instructions, specifications, designs or requirements to manufacture, sell, or ship the wafers or arising from any harm caused by our medical device products.

The FSA’s current term expires on December 31, 2026, subject to automatic renewal for successive two-year terms unless terminated by either party upon three months’ notice prior to the end of the then-current term. The FSA may also be terminated by written notice at any time upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of or upon or after a material breach by the other party. Either party may terminate the FSA immediately, with or without cause, by giving the other party 12 months’ prior written notice of termination. In addition, TSMC may terminate the FSA if we do not place a purchase order for a period of 12 consecutive months or upon certain change of control transactions, including a merger, consolidation or other change of control or similar transactions to which we are party involving a semiconductor provider.

In connection with the FSA, we and TSMC developed a proprietary manufacturing process and continue to collaborate on manufacturing process improvements.

Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Benchmark Electronics, Inc.

In October 2015, we entered into a Manufacture and Supply Agreement (the “MSA”) with Benchmark, as amended on August 2019 and February 2021. Under the MSA, Benchmark agreed to manufacture our products pursuant to binding purchase orders, as well as non-binding forecasts. The parties have agreed to meet periodically regarding any minimum order quantities under the MSA.

Under the terms of the MSA, we granted Benchmark a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, fully-paid, royalty-free license, without the right to sublicense, to use our technology solely to manufacture our products. The MSA provides that we will own any right, title and interest in any improvements or modifications to our technology made in the course of performance of Benchmark’s obligations under the MSA. We and Benchmark also agreed to indemnify each other against certain third-party claims.

The MSA’s current term expires on October 1, 2026, subject to automatic renewal for successive two-year terms unless either party gives 180 days’ prior written notice before the end of the then-current term to the other party electing not to renew the MSA. The MSA or any purchase order under the MSA may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to the other party. The MSA may also be terminated by either party by written notice upon the occurrence of (i) a breach by the other party under the MSA which is not cured within 30 days after written notice by the terminating party, (ii) the other party becomes insolvent, dissolves, liquidates or ceases to conduct business or (iii) the occurrence of payment-related breaches. Benchmark may also terminate the MSA upon the filing of any petition against us under bankruptcy or similar laws, where such petition is not vacated within 10 days via court order.

Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Cardinal Health 105, Inc.

In July 2018, we entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Cardinal Health 105, Inc. (“Cardinal Health”). Under the Distribution Agreement, Cardinal Health acts as the distribution agent and authorized distributor of record of our products to our customers, including, but not limited to, wholesalers, specialty distributors, physicians, clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, in the United States. Under the Distribution Agreement, we provide Cardinal Health with forecasts of the volume of our products to be handled and distributed by Cardinal Health. We make payments to Cardinal Health for its distribution services pursuant to a fee schedule. The Distribution Agreement’s current term expires on August 31, 2026. The Distribution Agreement is subject to automatic renewal for additional successive two-year terms unless terminated.

Intellectual Property

Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies.

The patents owned and in-licensed by us are generally directed to the architecture of our ultrasonic imaging devices, our microfabricated ultrasonic transducers and machine learning for ultrasound applications. We have developed a portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications directed to commercial products and technologies for potential development. We believe that our intellectual property is a core strength of our business, and our strategy includes the continued development of our patent portfolio.

As of February 13, 2025, we owned approximately 620 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom. These issued patents and pending patent applications (if they were to be issued as patents) have expected expiration dates ranging between approximately 2030 and 2045.

In addition to patents, we also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from using or incorporating the proprietary rights of third parties during their engagement with us. We also generally require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.

License Agreements

We have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business relating to our technologies or other intellectual property rights or assets.

Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with Leland Stanford Junior University

In June 2013, we entered into an Exclusive (Equity) Agreement (the “Stanford Agreement”) with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”). Pursuant to the Stanford Agreement, Stanford granted us a co-exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, and sell products covered by patent rights to Stanford’s wafer bonding technology. The rights licensed to us are for ultrasound applications using the wafer bonding technology excluding certain applications. As of December 23, 2023, the license became nonexclusive until the last licensed patent expires. The last licensed patent is currently expected to expire in 2030. The rights licensed to us are sublicensable, subject to Stanford’s prior approval. The Stanford Agreement outlines certain milestones to be met by us in connection with the development and sales of these products.

Under the terms of the Stanford Agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront royalty fee. We are required to pay Stanford low single-digit royalties on all net sales of products that use the licensed technology, as well as a portion of any sublicensing revenues, during the term of the Stanford Agreement and if certain products using the licensed technology are made, used, imported, or offered for sale before the date the Stanford Agreement terminates, and those products are sold after the termination date, we will pay Stanford an earned royalty for our exercise of rights based on the net sales of those products. We are also obligated to pay Stanford annual license maintenance fees, which are fully creditable against any 

page 16


royalty payments made by us for such year. We are also required to provide Stanford with periodic reports documenting our progress toward the development and commercialization of products using the licensed technology. Stanford is responsible under the agreement for preparing, filing and prosecuting patent claims and for maintaining the patents pertaining to the licensed technology.

Stanford may terminate the agreement in the event that we are materially delinquent on any payment, fail to diligently develop and commercialize a product incorporating the licensed technology, materially miss a milestone under the agreement, are in material breach of any substantive provision under the agreement, or knowingly provide any false report or are materially delinquent on any report, in each case which is not remedied within the applicable cure period. In addition, if we are not diligently developing and commercializing such a product incorporating the licensed technology, materially miss a milestone or knowingly provide a false report or are delinquent on any report, and we do not cure, the agreement shall not terminate, but it remains subject to termination by Stanford. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice. Upon termination of the agreement, all rights to the licensed technology revert to Stanford. Our obligation to pay royalties accrued or accruable survives any termination or expiration of the agreement. 

Government Regulation

The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device can be approved for marketing and commercial distribution. In addition, healthcare regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world impose a range of requirements related to paying for medical devices and the procedures in which they are used, including laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of healthcare dollars.

U.S. Government and Regulatory Requirements

The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device can be approved for marketing and commercial distribution. In addition, healthcare regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world impose a range of requirements related to paying for medical devices and the procedures in which they are used, including laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of healthcare dollars.

The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk. Butterfly devices are considered Class II devices which are considered moderate risk. There are also Class I (lowest risk) and Class III (highest risk) devices, with more stringent regulatory requirements applicable to higher-risk devices. Commercial sales of Class II (except for Class II exempt devices) and Class III medical devices in the U.S. must be preceded by either a pre-market notification filing pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA for Class II or the granting of a premarket approval for Class III. The development of a medical device typically requires extensive non-clinical testing and, for some devices, clinical testing involving human subjects.

After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including establishing registration and device listing, labeling, post-market record keeping and reporting, and the Quality System Regulation. These requirements are detailed, comprehensive, and require extensive investment and resources to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our offerings to ensure that our claims are consistent with our regulatory clearances and approvals, that there is data to substantiate the claims, and that our materials are not false or misleading. 

Pertaining to our veterinary devices, in the United States, the FDA does not require submission of a 510(k), PMA, or any premarket clearance or approval for devices used in veterinary medicine. Device manufacturers who exclusively manufacture or distribute veterinary devices are not required to register their establishments and list veterinary devices and 

page 17


are exempt from post-marketing reporting. The FDA has regulatory oversight over veterinary devices and can take appropriate regulatory action if a veterinary device is misbranded or adulterated. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer and/or distributor of these articles to assure that these veterinary devices are safe, effective, and properly labeled.

The marketing, promotion, and sale of medical devices, drugs, and services are regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and comparable U.S. state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of the delivery of healthcare items and services, representing government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Similar regulations are imposed in many global markets in which we do business. 

While Butterfly does not submit claims for reimbursement, the U.S. federal healthcare laws apply when our customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals, and healthcare fraud and abuse. These laws apply when claims are submitted for procedures that use our products. Similar state false claims, anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and insurance laws also apply to state-funded Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party payers. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties and expose us to civil liability and risk of further enforcement action under the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the False Claims Act (“FCA”), or other healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-cleared and -approved devices and drugs reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), which requires us to annually track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians and other healthcare professionals or U.S. teaching hospitals, and to similar state equivalents.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies from making corrupt payments to or otherwise engaging in bribery of government officials. These laws apply to many of our customer interactions, as healthcare professionals in other countries are often considered government officials, and in some cases lay out requirements of how to operationalize compliance with the legal requirements. Failure to comply with these laws may expose us to criminal and civil enforcement actions, monetary fines and penalties, and reputational harm.

International Laws and Regulations

International marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to regulation by foreign governments, and such regulations may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain marketing authorization in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the EU, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.

All new medical devices placed on the market or put into service in the EU must be compliant with and meet the general safety and performance requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (EU) No. 2017/745, which was implemented on May 26, 2021. Devices that conform to these requirements can be affixed with a CE marking and commercialized throughout the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in Switzerland (subject to certain additional requirements). Prior to affixing a CE marking, manufacturers must demonstrate that their products comply with minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality, through a conformity assessment procedure that depends on the product’s classification. The classification of a medical device is determined by its intended purpose. Devices are classified from lowest to highest risk, as either Class I, IIa, IIb, or III. Classification is dependent on a variety of factors, including duration of use, whether the device is invasive or non-invasive, and whether the device is considered “active.” The competent authorities of the EU countries are responsible for regulating clinical investigations of medical devices and post-market surveillance of devices once they are placed on the market.

Outside of the EU, regulatory authorization needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products and each country may have its own processes and requirements for medical device licensing, approval/clearance, and regulation. 

Data Privacy

Due to our global footprint and handling of personal data as both a data controller (on our own behalf) and data processor (on behalf of third parties, primarily customers), we are also subject to an extensive collection of global laws and 

page 18


regulations protecting the privacy, security and integrity of the personal data, sensitive personal data, and patient health information that we create, receive, use, and maintain as a business.

Among the most relevant and material to our business, based on the volume and sensitivity of the data at issue, are: the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information and Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively “HIPAA”); the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”), similar U.K. legislation resulting from the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018 (“U.K. GDPR”), and other EU country-level laws. In addition, there are also various U.S. state-level laws (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act), country regional laws, and proposed legislation that we monitor for applicability and impact to our business. These laws present a continuing challenge to businesses to structure their data collection, storage, use, and cross-border transmission in a compliant manner.

Many of these laws impose a significant compliance burden on organizations within their scope, and failure to comply can result in a variety of sanctions, including administrative fines for the most serious compliance failures up to 4-5% of a company’s total annual revenue of the preceding fiscal year (e.g., GDPR, U.K. GDPR, China PIPL). While there have been some recent enforcement actions by EU country-level data protection authorities resulting in substantial fines pursuant to GDPR, there remains uncertainty as to how data protection authorities throughout the rest of the globe will choose to interpret and enforce violations of applicable privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations. Furthermore, these laws and regulations are continuously evolving, and further clarification in the form of implementing rules, guidelines, and related guidance from the data protection authorities is necessary to paint a full picture of the compliance obligations imposed on businesses within their scope.
