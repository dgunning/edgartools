Item 1. Business.

Overview

Snap Inc. is a technology company. We believe the camera presents the greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. We contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. 

Our flagship product, Snapchat, is a visual messaging application that enhances your relationships with friends, family, and the world. Visual messaging is a fast, fun way to communicate with friends and family using augmented reality, video, voice, messaging, and creative tools. Snaps are deleted by default to mimic real-life conversations, so there is less pressure to look popular or perfect when creating and sending images on Snapchat. By reducing the friction typically associated with creating and sharing content, Snapchat has become one of the most used cameras in the world. 

The camera is a powerful tool for communication and the entry point for augmented reality experiences. By opening directly to the camera, Snapchat empowers our community to express themselves instantly and offers millions of augmented reality Lenses for self expression, learning, and play. In the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones. This is because images created by smartphone cameras contain more context and richer information than other forms of input like text entered on a keyboard. Given the magnitude of this opportunity, we are investing and innovating to continue to deliver products and services that are differentiated and that are better able to reflect and improve our life experiences.

Snapchat

Snapchat is our core mobile device application and contains five distinct tabs, complemented by additional tools that function outside of the application. With a breadth of visual messaging and content experiences available within the application, Snapchatters can interact with any or all of the five tabs.

Camera: The Camera is a powerful tool for communication and the entry point for augmented reality experiences in Snapchat. Snapchat opens directly to the Camera, making it easy to create a Snap and send it to friends. Our augmented reality, or AR, capabilities within our Camera allow for creativity and self-expression. We offer millions of Lenses, created by both us and our community, along with creative tools and licensed music and audio clips, which make it easy for people to personalize and contextualize their Snaps. We also offer voice and scanning technology within our Camera. While Snaps are deleted by default to mimic real-life conversations, Snapchatters can save their creativity through a searchable collection of Memories stored on both their Snapchat account and their mobile device.

Visual Messaging: Visual Messaging is a fast, fun way to communicate with friends and family using AR, video, voice, messaging, and creative tools. We also offer My AI, our AI-powered chatbot, which helps our community foster creativity and connection with friends, receive real-world recommendations, and learn more about their interests and favorite subjects. They can also communicate through our proprietary personalized avatar tool, Bitmoji, and its associated contextual stickers and images, which integrate seamlessly into both mobile devices and desktop browsers.

Snap Map: Snap Map is a live and highly personalized map that allows Snapchatters to connect with friends and explore what is going on in their local area. Snap Map makes it easy to locate nearby friends who choose to share their location, view a heatmap of recent Snaps posted to Our Story by location, and locate local businesses. Places, rich profiles of local businesses that include information such as store hours and reviews, overlay specialized experiences from select partners on top of Snap Map, and allow Snapchatters to take direct actions from Snap Map, such as sharing a favorite store, ordering takeout, or making a reservation.

Stories: Stories are a fun way to stay connected, and feature content from friends, our community, and our content partners. Friends Stories allow Snapchatters to express themselves in narrative form through photos and videos, shown in chronological order, to their friends. The Discover section of this tab displays curated content based on a Snapchatter’s subscriptions and interests, and features news and entertainment from both our creator community and publisher partners. We also offer Public Profiles as a way for our creator community and our advertising partners to memorialize and scale their content and AR Lenses on our platform.

Spotlight: Spotlight showcases the best of Snapchat, helping people discover new creators and content in a personalized way. Here we surface the most entertaining Snaps from our community all in one place, which becomes tailored to each Snapchatter over time based on their preferences and favorites. The Trending page allows Snapchatters to discover and engage with popular topics and genres.

We are currently testing a new and simplified version of Snapchat referred to as Simple Snapchat, which organizes the tabs into three core experiences focused on communicating with friends, using the camera, and watching entertaining content.

In addition to our core Snapchat product, we offer Snapchat+, our subscription service that provides subscribers access to exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features. Snapchat+ offers a variety of features from allowing Snapchatters to customize the look and feel of their app to giving special insights into their friendships. We also offer Snapchat for Web, a browser-based product that brings Snapchat’s signature capabilities to the web.

Spectacles are our wearable AR glasses, which overlay computing over the world and extend the immersive AR Lenses experience beyond Snapchat. Spectacles are powered by Snap OS, a new purpose-built operating system with a natural interface that uses your hands and voice without the need for physical controllers. Spectacles are available to professional and hobbyist developers through our Spectacle Developer Program to create AR experiences through Lens Studio, our free AR development and distribution tool.

Our Partner Ecosystem

Many elements and features of Snapchat are enhanced by our expansive partner ecosystem that includes developers, creators, publishers, and advertisers, among others. We help them create and bring diverse content and experiences into Snapchat, leverage Snapchat capabilities in their own applications and websites, and use advertising to promote these and other experiences to our large, engaged, and differentiated user base. We seek to reward our partner ecosystem for their creativity, and continue to support them as they grow their audience and build their business on Snapchat.

Developers are able to integrate with Snapchat and its core technologies, like Snap’s AR Camera and Bitmoji, through a variety of tools. Creative Kit gives developers and their communities a seamless sharing experience from their app directly to Snapchat. Through Camera Kit, our partners can embed Snap’s AR platform directly into their application, extending the use of AR beyond self-expression and communication use cases. We also provide developers a turnkey suite of tools and services that enable them to create AR Lenses and track the performance of those through analytics. Finally, developers can bring an inclusive mode of identity and expression to their apps and games with our Bitmoji for Developers APIs.

AR creators can use Lens Studio, our powerful desktop application designed for creators and developers, to build Lenses and AR experiences for Snapchatters. Spotlight creators can utilize our content creation tools to reach millions of Snapchatters and build their businesses through various monetization opportunities. Our Creator Marketplace connects both AR and Spotlight creators directly with our advertising partners. We provide monetizable opportunities through programs like the Snap Lens Network and Spectacles Lens Fund, which provide grants to support AR product development across many industries. We recognize and reward top performing Lenses through our Lens Creator Rewards program. We also support our content creator community through a number of programs, including advertising revenue sharing on our mid-roll advertisements in Snap Stars’ Stories and Spotlight.

Publisher partners can expand their audiences and monetize content through our Discover section. In addition, we work with various telecommunications providers and original equipment manufacturers, particularly as we build our presence in new markets.

Our Advertising Products

We connect both brand and direct response advertisers to Snapchatters globally. Our ad products are built on the same foundation that makes our consumer products successful. This means that we can take the things we learn while creating our consumer products and apply them to building innovative and engaging advertising products familiar to our community.

AR Ads: Advertising through Snap’s AR tools unlocks the ability to reach a unique audience in a highly differentiated way through AR Lenses. AR Lenses are designed through our camera to take advantage of the reach and scale of our augmented reality platform to create visually engaging 3D experiences, including the ability to visualize and try on products such as beauty, apparel, accessories, and footwear. AR Lenses can be memorialized on Snapchat, through Public Profiles that aggregate content and lenses in a single, easy to find place.

Snap Ads: We let advertisers tell their stories the same way our users do, using full screen videos with sound. These also allow advertisers to integrate additional experiences and actions directly within these advertisements, including watching a long-form video, visiting a website, or installing an app. Snap Ads include the following:

•Single Image or Video Ads: These are full screen ads that are skippable, and can contain an attachment to enable Snapchatters to swipe up and take action. 

•Story Ads: Story Ads are branded tiles that live within the Discover section of the Stories tab that can be either video ads or a series of 3 to 20 images. 

•Collection Ads: Collection Ads feature four tappable tiles to showcase multiple products, giving Snapchatters a frictionless way to browse and buy. 

•Dynamic Ads: Dynamic ads leverage our machine learning algorithm to match a product catalog to serve the right ad to the right Snapchatter at the right time. 

•Commercials: Commercials are non-skippable for six seconds, but can last up to three minutes. These ads appear within Snapchat’s curated content.

•Sponsored Snaps: Sponsored Snaps allow advertisers to communicate visually with the Snapchat community through sponsored messages within the chat tab.

•Promoted Places: Promoted Places allow businesses to use the Snap Map to suggest sponsored places of interest to Snapchatters by highlighting the brand’s locations on the Snap Map with a promoted pin.

Campaign Management and Delivery: We aim to continually improve the way these ad formats are purchased and delivered. We have invested heavily to build our self-serve advertising platform, which provides automated, sophisticated, and scalable ad buying and campaign management.

We offer the ability to bid for advertisements that are designated to drive Snapchatters to: visit a website, make a purchase, visit a local business, call or text a business, watch a story or video, download an app, or return to an app, among others. Additionally, our delivery framework continues to optimize relevance of ads across the entire platform by determining the best ad to show to any given user based on their real-time and historical attributes and activity. This decreases the number of wasted impressions while improving the effectiveness of the ads that are shown to our community. This helps advertisers increase their return on investment by providing more refined targeting, the ability to test and learn with different creatives or campaign attributes in real time, and the dynamics of our self-serve pricing.

Measuring Advertising Effectiveness: We offer first-party measurement solutions and we support our advertising partners preferred third-party measurement solutions to provide a vast array of analytics on campaign attributes like reach, frequency, demographics, and viewability; changes in perceptions like brand favorability or purchase intent; and lifts in actual behavior like purchases, foot traffic, app installs, and online purchases.

Technology

Our research and development efforts focus on product development, advertising technology, and large-scale infrastructure.

Product Development: We work relentlessly and invest deliberately to create and improve products for our community and our partners. We develop a wide range of products related to visual messaging and storytelling that are powered by a variety of new technologies.

Advertising Technology: We constantly develop and expand our advertising products and technology. In an effort to provide a strong and scalable return on investment to our advertisers, our advertising technology roadmap centers around improving our delivery framework, measurement capabilities, and self-serve tools.

Large-scale Infrastructure: We spend considerable resources and investment on the underlying architecture that powers our products, such as optimizing the delivery of billions of videos to hundreds of millions of people around the world every day. We currently partner with third party providers to support the infrastructure for our growing needs. These partnerships have allowed us to scale quickly without upfront physical infrastructure costs, allowing us to focus our efforts on product innovation.

Employees and Culture

We seek to be a force for good through our products, our work to strengthen our communities, our efforts to make a positive impact on the planet, and our inclusive workplace.

Supporting Our Team: Our values at Snap are being kind, smart, and creative, and we put those values into action through how we support our team and how our team supports one another. Council, which is a practice of active listening that promotes open-mindedness and cultivates empathy and compassion among participants, helps us build and sustain a community steeped in integrity, connection, collaboration, creativity, and kindness. Our talent development programs seek to unlock potential by helping team members advance, learn, and grow in a fair and equitable way at Snap. We focus on the health and well-being of our employees through programs and benefits that support their physical, emotional, and financial fitness. To attract and retain the best talent, we offer challenging work in an environment that enables our employees to have a direct meaningful contribution to new and exciting projects. Underlying these values is our commitment to ethical conduct where we work to instill in our team that acting with integrity means being your whole self, being honest, and doing the right thing.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Snap has long supported Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI, so that every team member uses their unique backgrounds, experiences, and abilities to build products that uplift the lived experiences of Snapchatters globally. To aid in our mission, we publish a Diversity Annual Report that discusses our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy. This report outlines our beliefs around the idea that an inclusive workplace and inclusive products are central to achieving that purpose. This report is excerpted in our broader CitizenSnap Report that details the work we’re doing to support our communities, our planet, and our team, and is available on our website at www.snap.com.

Human Capital: As part of our human capital resource objectives, we seek to recruit, retain, and incentivize our highly talented existing and future employees. We believe that creating an inclusive environment where team members can grow, develop, and be their true selves is critical to attracting and retaining talent. Our compensation philosophies also align to that belief.

Our compensation philosophy is based around building a culture of ownership and high performance by putting both impact and our values at the center of our performance feedback process and pay outcomes. We utilize equity as part of our compensation practices to drive a long-term orientation and have committed to paying a minimum living wage for all employees globally.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 4,911 full-time employees, of whom approximately 52% are in engineering roles involved in the design, development, support, and manufacture of new and existing products and processes.

Climate Change: Our commitment to combating climate change remains unchanged. In 2021, we adopted a set of science-based emissions reduction targets which were validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative. Additionally, in 2021, we achieved carbon neutrality with the purchase of carbon offsets for our historical operations from our founding in 2011 through 2020. Since then, we’ve maintained our carbon-neutral status each year through the purchase of carbon offsets for emissions attributable to us.

Our Commitment to Privacy

Our approach to privacy is simple: Be upfront, offer choices, and never forget that our community comes first.

We built Snapchat as an antidote to the context-less communication that has plagued “social media.” Not so long ago, a conversation among friends would be just that: a private communication in which you knew exactly who you were talking to, what you were talking about, and whether what you were saying was being memorialized for eternity. Somewhere along the way, social media—by prioritizing virality and permanence—sapped conversations of this valuable context and choice. When we began to communicate online, we lost some of what made communication great: spontaneity, emotion, honesty—the full range of human expression that makes us human in the first place.

page 9


We don’t think digital communication has to be this way. That’s why choice matters. We build products and services that emphasize the context of a conversation—who, when, what, and where something is being said. If you don’t have the autonomy to shape the context of a conversation, the conversation will simply be shaped by the permanent feeds that homogenize online conversations.

When you read our Privacy Policy, we hope that you’ll notice how much we care about the integrity of personal communication. For starters, we’ve written our Privacy Policy in plain language because we think it’s important that everyone understands exactly how we handle their information. Otherwise, it’s hard to make informed choices about how you communicate. We’ve also created a robust Privacy, Safety, and Policy Hub where we show that context and choice are more than talking points. There, we point out the many ways that users can control who sees their Snaps and Stories, and explain how long content will remain on our servers, how users can manage the information that we do have about them, and much more. This is where you’ll also find our Transparency Report in which we provide insight into these efforts and visibility into the nature and volume of content reported on our platform.

We also understand that privacy policies—no matter how ambitious—are only as good as the people and practices behind those policies. When someone trusts us to transmit or store their information, we know we have a responsibility to protect that information and we work hard to keep it secure. New features go through an intense privacy-review process—we debate pros and cons, and we work hard to build products we’re proud of and that we’ll want to use. We handle user information with the same care that we want for our family, our friends, and ourselves.

Competition

We compete with other companies in every aspect of our business, particularly with companies that focus on mobile engagement and advertising. Many of these companies, such as Alphabet (including Google and YouTube), Apple, ByteDance (including TikTok), Meta (including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp), Pinterest, and X (formerly Twitter), may have greater financial and human resources and, in some cases, larger user bases. Given the breadth of our product offerings, we also compete with companies that develop products or otherwise operate in the mobile, camera, communication, content, and advertising industries that offer, or will offer, products and services that may compete with Snapchat features or offerings. Our competitors span from internet technology companies and digital platforms, to traditional companies in print, radio, and television sectors to underlying technologies like default smartphone cameras and messaging. Additionally, our competition for engagement varies by region. For instance, we face competition from companies like Kakao, LINE, Naver (including Snow), and Tencent in Asia.

We compete to attract and retain our users’ attention, both in terms of reach and engagement. Since our products and those of our competitors are typically free, we compete based on our brand and the quality and nature of our product offerings rather than on price. As such, we invest heavily in constantly improving and expanding our product lines.

We also compete with other companies to attract and retain partners and advertisers, which depends primarily on our reach and ability to deliver a strong return on investment.

Finally, we compete to attract and retain highly talented individuals, including software engineers, designers, and product managers. In addition to providing competitive compensation packages, we compete for talent by fostering a culture of working hard to create great products and experiences and allowing our employees to have a direct meaningful contribution to new and exciting projects.

Seasonality in Our Business

We have historically seen seasonality in our business. Overall advertising spend tends to be strongest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, and we have observed a similar pattern in our historical revenue. We have also experienced seasonality in our user engagement, generally seeing lower engagement during summer months and higher engagement in December.

Intellectual Property

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, license agreements, internal procedures, and contractual provisions. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and 

page 10


contractors and sign confidentiality agreements with third parties. Our internal controls are designed to restrict access to proprietary technology.

As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 4,169 issued patents and approximately 3,263 filed patent applications in the United States and foreign countries relating to our Snapchat, Lens Studio, Spectacles and Snap OS products, augmented reality, AI and machine learning, and other technologies. Our issued patents will expire between 2025 and 2047. We may not be able to obtain protection for our intellectual property, and our existing and future patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors.

We license content, trademarks, technology, and other intellectual property from our partners, and rely on our license agreements with those partners to use the intellectual property. We also enter into licensing agreements with third parties to receive rights to patents and other know-how. Third parties may assert claims related to intellectual property rights against our partners or us.

Other companies and “non-practicing entities” that own patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights related to the mobile, camera, communication, content, internet, and other technology-related industries frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, and other violations of intellectual property or other rights. As our business continues to grow and competition increases, we will likely face more claims related to intellectual property and litigation matters.

Government Regulation

We are subject to many federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to advertising, algorithms, anti-money laundering, competition, consumer protection, content regulation, data protection, electronic funds transfers, employment, encryption, gift cards, health and safety, import and export restrictions, intellectual property, communication, money transmission, privacy, protection of minors, rights of publicity, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our business. Like other companies in our industry, we face increasingly heightened scrutiny from both the United States and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the consent order that we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, in December 2014, which resolved an investigation into some of our early practices. That order requires, among other things, that we establish a robust privacy program to govern how we treat user data. During the 20-year lifespan of the order, we must complete biennial independent privacy audits. The FTC has continued to review our practices and in January 2025, announced the referral of a complaint to the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, pertaining to our deployment of our My AI feature and the allegedly resulting risk of harm to young users. Any enforcement action related to this matter, or any violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation, and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. It is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all our products for an extended period of time or indefinitely. Due to such laws and regulations, our products may not be available in all locations. Our public policy team monitors legal and regulatory developments in the United States, as well as many foreign countries, and communicates with policymakers and regulators in the United States and internationally.
