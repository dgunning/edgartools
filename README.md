# Getting started

Install using pip
```bash
pip install edgartools
```

Import and start using
```python
from edgar import *

# Tell the SEC who you are
set_identity("Michael Mccallum mike.mccalum@indigo.com")

filings = get_filings()
```

# Key Concepts

## How do I find a filing?
Depends on what you know

### A. I know the accession number

```python
filing = find("0001065280-23-000273")
```

### B. I know the company ticker or cik

```python
filings = Company("NFLX").get_filings(form="10-Q").latest(1)
```

For a deeper dive see **[Finding things with edgartools](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/wiki/FindingThings)**

### C. Show me a list of filings

```python
filings = get_filings(form="10-Q")
filing = filings[0]
```

## What can I do with a filing

You can **view** it in the terminal or **open** it in the browser, get the filing as **html**, **xml** or **text**, 
and download **attachments**. You can extract data from the filing into a data object.

## What can I do with a company

You can get the company's **filings**, **facts** and **financials**.

# Installation

```console
pip install edgartools
```

# Usage


## Set your Edgar user identity

Before you can access the SEC Edgar API you need to set the identity that you will use to access Edgar.
This is usually your name and email, or a company name and email but you can also just use an email.
```bash
Sample Company Name AdminContact@<sample company domain>.com
```

The user identity is sent in the User-Agent string and the Edgar API will refuse to respond to your request without it.

EdgarTools will look for an environment variable called `EDGAR_IDENTITY` and use that in each request.
So, you need to set this environment variable before using it.

### Setting EDGAR_IDENTITY in Linux/Mac
```bash
export EDGAR_IDENTITY="mcalum@gmail.com"
```

### Setting EDGAR_IDENTITY in Windows Powershell
```bash
 $Env:EDGAR_IDENTITY="mcalum@gmail.com"
```
Alternatively, you can call `set_identity` which does the same thing.

```python
from edgar import set_identity
set_identity("mcalum@gmail.com")
```
For more detail see https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data

## Usage

### Importing edgar

```python
from edgar import *
```

## [Using the Filing API](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/wiki/WorkingWithFilings)
Use the Filing API when you are not working with a specific company, but want to get a list of filings.

For details on how to use the Filing API see **[Using the Filing API](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/wiki/WorkingWithFilings)**

## [Using the Company API](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/wiki/WorkingWithCompanies)

With the Company API you can find a company by ticker or CIK, and get the company's filings, facts and financials.

```python
Company("AAPL")
        .get_filings(form="10-Q")
        .latest(1)
        .obj()
```

![expe](docs/images/aapl-10Q.png)

See **[Using the Company API](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/wiki/WorkingWithCompanies)**

## Viewing and downloading attachments

Every filing has a list of attachments. You can view the attachments using `filing.attachments`

```python
# View the attachments
filing.attachments
```
![Filing attachments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/filing_attachments.png)

You can access each attachment using the bracket operator `[]` and the index of the attachment.
    
```python
# Get the first attachment
attachment = filing.attachments[0]
```

![Filing attachments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/filing_attachment.png)

You can download the attachment using `attachment.download()`. This will download the attachment to string or bytes in memory. 

## Automatic parsing of filing data

Now the reason you may want to download attachments is to get information contained in data files.
For example, **13F-HR** filings have attached infotable.xml files containing data from the holding report for that filing.

Fortunately, the library handles this for you. If you call `filing.obj()` it will automatically download and parse the data files
into a data object, for several different form types. Currently, the following forms are supported:

| Form                       | Data Object                  | Description                           |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 10-K                       | `TenK`                       | Annual report                         |
| 10-Q                       | `TenQ`                       | Quarterly report                      |
| 8-K                        | `EightK`                     | Current report                        |
| MA-I                       | `MunicipalAdvisorForm`       | Municipal advisor initial filing      |
| Form 144                   | `Form144`                    | Notice of proposed sale of securities |
| C, C-U, C-AR, C-TR         | `FormC`                      | Form C Crowdfunding Offering          |
| D                          | `FormD`                      | Form D Offering                       |
| 3,4,5                      | `Ownership`                  | Ownership reports                     |
| 13F-HR                     | `ThirteenF`                  | 13F Holdings Report                   |
| NPORT-P                    | `FundReport`                 | Fund Report                           |
| EFFECT                     | `Effect`                     | Notice of Effectiveness               |
| And other filing with XBRL | `XBRLData` or `XBRLInstance` | Container for XBRL data               |

For example, to get the data object for a **13F-HR** filing you can do the following:

```python
filings = get_filings(form="13F-HR")
filing = filings[0]
thirteenf = filing.obj()
```

![Filing attachments](docs/images/thirteenF.png)

If you call `obj()` on a filing that does not have a data file, then it will return `None`.


## Working with XBRL filings

Some filings are in **XBRL (eXtensible Business Markup Language)** format. 
These are mainly the newer filings, as the SEC has started requiring this for newer filings.

If a filing is in XBRL format then it opens up a lot more ways to get structured data about that specific filing and also 
about the company referred to in that filing.

The `Filing` class has an `xbrl` function that will download, parse and structure the filing's XBRL document if one exists.
If it does not exist, then `filing.xbrl()` will return `None`.

The function `filing.xbrl()` returns an `XBRLData` instance if the XBRL files contain presentation information or `XBRLInstance` if it a simple instance document with just the facts.
For more details see **[Parsing XBRL](https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/wiki/ParsingXBRL)**

```python
filing_xbrl = filing.xbrl()
```

![Filing homapage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/10Q_xbrl.jpg)

## Financials

Some filings, notably **10-K** and **10-Q** filings contain financial statements in XBRL format. 
You can get the financials from the XBRL data using the `Financials` class.

```python
from edgar.financials import Financials
financials = Financials(filing.xbrl())
financials.get_balance_sheet()
financials.get_income_statement()
financials.get_cash_flow_statement()
```
Or automatically through the `Tenk` and `TenQ` data objects.

Here is an example that gets the latest Apple financials

```python
tenk = Company("AAPL").get_filings(form="10-K").latest(1).obj()
financials = tenk.financials
financials.get_balance_sheet
```
![Balance Sheet](docs/images/balance_sheet.png)

### Get the financial data as a pandas dataframe

Each of the financial statements - `BalanceSheet`, `IncomeStatement` and `CashFlowStatement` - have a `get_dataframe()` method that will return the data as a pandas dataframe.

```python
balance_sheet_df = financials.get_balance_sheet().get_dataframe()
```

## Downloading Edgar Data

The library is designed to make real time calls to EDGAR to get the latest data. However, you may want to download data for offline use or to build a dataset.

### Download Bulk Company Data
You can download all the company **filings** and **facts** from Edgar using the `download_edgar_data` function.
Note that this will store json files for each company of their facts and submissions, but it will not include the actual HTML or other attachments.
It will however dramatically speed up loading companies by cik or ticker.

The submissions and facts bulk data files are each over 1.GB in size, and take around a few minutes each.
The data is stored by default in the `~/.edgar` directory. You can change this by setting the `EDGAR_LOCAL_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

```bash

```python
def download_edgar_data(submissions: bool = True, facts: bool = True):
    """
    Download all the company data from Edgar
    :param submissions: Download all the company submissions
    :param facts: Download all the company facts
    """
download_edgar_data()

```
### Using Bulk Data
If you want edgartools to use the bulk data files you can call `use_local_storage()` before you start making calls using the library.
Alternatively, set `EDGAR_USE_LOCAL_DATA` to `True` in your environment.

### Downsides of using bulk data
- The filings downloaded for each company is limited to the last 1000

You can download attachments from a filing using the `download` method on the attachments. This will download all the attached files to a folder of your choice.

```python
class Attachments:
    
    ...
    
    def download(self, path: Union[str, Path], archive: bool = False):
        """
        Download all the attachments to a specified path.
        If the path is a directory, the file is saved with its original name in that directory.
        If the path is a file, the file is saved with the given path name.
        If archive is True, the attachments are saved in a zip file.
        path: str or Path - The path to save the attachments
        archive: bool (default False) - If True, save the attachments in a zip file
        """ 
        ...
        
# Usage
filing.attachments.download(path)
```
