## [3.10.2] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- Add `attachments.get_by_index` to get attachments by index. Indexing starts at 0. There is also `get_by_sequence` that starts at 1

## [3.10.1] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- Improved rich styling of attachments
- Implement parsing of FilingSummary
- Implement getting content of individual SGML reports
- Implement viewing individual attachments in the SGML report e.g. balance sheet, income statement, etc.

- `EDGAR_USE_LOCAL_DATA` now accepts more boolean values `'y', 'yes', 't', 'true', 'on', '1'` or `'n', 'no', 'f', 'false', 'off', '0'` to enable or disable local storage. This is to make it easier to set the environment variable in different environments.

## [3.10.0] - 2025-01-26

### Changed
- This release uses SGML as the primary means of getting attachments and text from SEC filings. This is a significant change from the previous release that used the Filing homepage and access the documents directly. This will make it work better with local storage

### Fixed
- Fixed bug when downloading data to local storage


## [3.9.0] - 2025-01-20
