## [Unreleased]


### Changed
- Refactored the code that used HTTPX client connections to reuse connections. Reusing HTTPX client connections yields about a 20ms savings per request in retrieval in limited tests. (Thanks to paul @ igmo)
- Consolidated the httpx client connection to a single edgartools.httpclient module. This will allow for more control over the client and the ability to pass the client explicitly to functions that need it.
