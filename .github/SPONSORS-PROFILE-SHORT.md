## How I Build This

I develop EdgarTools using AI-assisted development with Claude Max, delivering **3-10x faster** than traditional methods.

> ⚡ **Last 60 Days**: 24 releases (1 every 2.5 days) • 322 commits • Features in days, not weeks

**The deal**: Your sponsorship funds Claude Max ($200/mo) → I ship features at extraordinary velocity → You get more features, faster fixes, free forever
