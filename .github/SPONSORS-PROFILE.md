## 💡 What I'm Building

**EdgarTools** makes SEC filing analysis accessible to everyone - from individual investors to Fortune 500 data scientists. No API keys, no rate limits, just elegant Python code that works.

**Current stats:**
- ⭐ **1.3k+ stars** on GitHub (growing fast!)

## 🚀 The AI Velocity Story

I develop EdgarTools using **AI-assisted development** with Claude Max, and the results are extraordinary:

### Last 60 Days
| Metric | Value | What It Means |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| 🎯 **24 releases** | 1 every 2.5 days | Continuous improvements |
| ⚡ **322 commits** | 5.4 per day | Active development |
| 🔥 **3-10x faster** | vs traditional dev | Features in days, not weeks |

### Recent Examples
- **XBRL Period Selection**: 3-4 weeks → **5 days** (7x faster)
- **MCP Workflow Tools**: 2-3 weeks → **2 days** (10x faster)
- **HTML Parsing Rewrite**: 2 weeks → **3 days** (4x faster)
- **Standardized Concepts API**: 2 weeks → **2-3 days** (5x faster)

## 💛 The Virtuous Cycle

Your sponsorship creates a **feedback loop that benefits everyone**:

1. **You Support** → Your contribution funds Claude Max ($200/month)
2. **AI Acceleration** → Specialized agents deliver 3-10x faster development
3. **Rapid Delivery** → Features ship in days instead of weeks
4. **You Benefit** → More features, faster fixes, free forever

**This means your contribution doesn't just "help maintenance" - it directly funds the AI tools that let me ship features at extraordinary velocity.**

# 🏢 CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP

*For organizations using EdgarTools in production or for SEC compliance*

**EdgarTools is critical infrastructure for SEC compliance.** If your organization depends on EdgarTools for regulatory reporting, financial analysis, or compliance operations, sponsorship is insurance against operational and regulatory risk.

## The Risk Equation

> **SEC filing processing failure = Regulatory non-compliance or operational errors**
>
> **Cost of failure >> Cost of sponsorship**
>
> **Sponsorship = Insurance, not charity**
