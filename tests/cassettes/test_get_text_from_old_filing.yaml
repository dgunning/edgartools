        Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
        AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nInterim information is unaudited;
        however, in the opinion of the Company's\nmanagement, all adjustments of a
        normal recurring nature necessary for a fair\nstatement of interim periods
        presented have been included. The results for\ninterim periods are not necessarily
        indicative of results to be expected for the\nentire year. These condensed
        consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes should be read in
        conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and
        the notes thereto for the year ended September 25,\n1999, included in its
        Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September\n25, 1999 (the 1999
        Form 10-K). All information is based on the Company's fiscal\ncalendar.\n\nNOTE
        2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing
        income available to common\nshareholders by the weighted-average number of
        shares of common stock\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
        share is computed by\ndividing income available to common shareholders by
        the weighted-average number\nof shares of common stock outstanding during
        the period increased to include the\nnumber of additional common shares that
        would have been outstanding if dilutive\npotential common shares had been
        issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding\noptions is reflected in diluted
        earnings per share by application of the\ntreasury stock method. The dilutive
        effect of convertible securities is\nreflected using the if-converted method.\n\nThe
        following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per\nshare
        (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n

        to purchase approximately 209,750 and 253,000 shares of common stock\nwere
        outstanding as of April 1, 2000, and March 27, 1999, respectively, that\nwere
        not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for these\nquarters
        because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market\nprice
        of the Company's common stock during those periods and, therefore, the\neffect
        would be antidilutive.\n\nDuring the first two quarters of 1999, the Company
        had outstanding $661 million\nof unsecured convertible subordinated debentures
        (the Debentures) which were\nconvertible by their holders into approximately
        22.6 million shares of common\nstock at a conversion price of $29.205 per
        share. The weighted average common\nshares represented by the Debentures upon
        conversion were included in the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share
        for the three and six month periods\nended March 27, 1999, using the if-converted
        method. On April 14, 1999, the\nCompany called for redemption the Debentures.
        As a result, debenture holders\nconverted virtually all of the outstanding
        debentures to 22.6 million shares of\nthe Company's common stock in 1999.

        Company holds significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Samsung\nElectronics
        Co., Ltd (Samsung), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink\nNetwork,
        Inc. (EarthLink). These investments are reflected in the consolidated\nbalance
        sheets as non-current debt and equity investments and have been\ncategorized
        as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value\nwith unrealized
        gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a\ncomponent of accumulated
        other comprehensive income. The combined fair value of\nthese investments
        was $1.544 billion and $339 million as of April 1, 2000, and\nSeptember 25,
        1999, respectively. The combined fair value of these investments\nhas declined
        to approximately $1.215 billion as of May 5, 2000. The Company\nbelieves it
        is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the\nfair
        value of these investments in the future.\n\nARM is a publicly held company
        in the United Kingdom involved in the design and\nlicensing of high performance
        microprocessors and related technology. As of\nSeptember 25, 1999, the Company
        held approximately 16 million shares of ARM\nstock with a fair value of $226
        million. During the first quarter of 2000, the\nCompany sold approximately
        5.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of\napproximately $136 million
        and a gain before taxes of $134 million. During the\nsecond quarter of 2000,
        the Company sold approximately 1.5 million shares of ARM\nstock for net proceeds
        of $101 million and a gain before taxes of $100 million.\nDuring the first
        quarter of 1999, the Company sold approximately 11.6 million\nshares of ARM
        stock for net proceeds of approximately $37 million and a gain\nbefore taxes
        of $32 million. During the second quarter of 1999, the Company sold\n8 million
        shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $59 million and\na gain
        before taxes of approximately $55 million. As of April 1, 2000, the\nCompany
        holds 9.4 million shares of ARM stock with a fair value of $566 million.\nShare
        data for ARM presented in this Form 10-Q has not been adjusted to reflect\nARM's
        five-for-one split in April of 2000.\n\nIn January 2000, the Company invested
        $200 million in EarthLink, an Internet\nservice provider (ISP). The investment

        by the Company after January 4, 2001, into\napproximately 7.1 million shares
        of EarthLink common stock. Apple also received\na seat on EarthLink's Board
        of Directors. Concurrent with this investment,\nEarthlink and the Company
        entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP\nservice to Macintosh users
        in the United States. Under the terms of the\nagreement, the Company will
        profit from each new Mac customer that subscribes to\nEarthLink's ISP service,
        and EarthLink will become the default ISP in Apple's\nInternet Setup Software
        included with all Macintosh computers sold in the United\nStates. The fair
        value of the Company's investment in EarthLink is approximately\n$138 million
        as of April 1, 2000.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested
        $100 million in Samsung\nto assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD

        year unsecured bonds,\nis convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of
        Samsung common stock\nbeginning in June 2000. The bonds carry an annual coupon
        rate of 2% and pay a\ntotal yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their maturity.
        The fair value of\nthe Company's investment in Samsung is approximately $179
        million as of Apri1 1,\n2000.\n\n                                       7\n\n<PAGE>\n\nIn

        for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public\noffering
        in October 1999. The Company is restricted from selling more than 25%\nof
        its shares within one year after the date of the closing of the public\noffering
        of Akamai's stock. Beginning in the first quarter of 2000, the Company\ncategorized
        its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale. As of April 1, 2000, the\nCompany's
        investment in Akamai has a fair value of $661 million.\n\n\nNOTE 5 - SHAREHOLDERS'

        July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company\nto
        repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does\nnot
        obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire\nshares
        over any specified period of time. During the second quarter of 2000, no\nshares
        of common stock were repurchased. Since inception of the stock repurchase\nplan,
        the Company has repurchased a total of 1.75 million shares of its common\nstock
        at a total cost of $116 million.\n\nNOTE 6 - COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n\nComprehensive
        income is comprised of two components, net income and other\ncomprehensive
        income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses,\ngains and
        losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are\nrecorded as
        an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income.\nThe
        Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency\ntranslation
        adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as\ntheir functional
        currency and from unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, on\nmarketable
        securities categorized as available-for-sale. See Note 4 regarding\nunrealized

        ACTIONS\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring
        actions\nresulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This
        charge was\ncomprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating
        assets and $5\nmillion for severance payments to approximately 95 employees
        associated with\nconsolidation of various domestic and international sales
        and marketing\nfunctions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $1.7 million
        had been spent\nby April 1, 2000, and the remainder is expected to be spent
        over the following\ntwo quarters. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off
        of various assets,\nsubstantially all was utilized by April 1, 2000.\n\nDuring
        the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company initiated restructuring actions\nresulting
        in a charge to operations of $21 million comprised of $11 million for\ncontract
        cancellation charges associated with the closure of the Company's\noutsourced
        data center, $9.2 million of which had been spent by the end of the\nsecond
        quarter of 2000, and $10 million for contract cancellation charges\nrelated
        to supply and development agreements previously discontinued, all of\nwhich
        had been spent by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2000.\n\nEXECUTIVE
        BONUS\n\nIn December 1999, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special
        executive\nbonus for past services for the Company's Chief Executive Officer
        in the form of\nan aircraft with a total cost to the company of approximately
        $90 million, the\nmajority of which is not tax deductible. Approximately half
        of the total charge\nis the cost of the aircraft. The other half represents
        all other costs and taxes\nassociated with the purchase.\n\nNOTE 8 - SEGMENT
        INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily
        on a geographic basis. The Company's\nreportable segments are comprised of
        the Americas, Europe, and Japan. The\nAmericas segment includes both North
        and South America. The European segment\nincludes European countries as well
        as the Middle East and Africa. Other\noperating segments include Asia-Pacific,
        which includes Australia and Asia\nexcept for Japan, and the Company's subsidiary,
        Filemaker, Inc. Each reportable\noperating segment provides similar products
        and services, and the accounting\npolicies of the various segments are the
        same as those described in the 1999\nForm 10-K.\n\n\n                                       9\n<PAGE>\n\nThe
        Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net\nsales
        and operating income. Operating income for each segment includes revenue,\ncost
        of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Net\nsales
        are based on the location of the customers. Operating income for each\nsegment
        excludes other income and expense and certain expenses that are managed\noutside
        the reportable segment. Costs excluded from segment operating income\ninclude
        various corporate expenses, income taxes, and nonrecurring charges for\npurchased
        in-process research and development, restructuring, and acquisition\nrelated
        costs. Corporate expenses include research and development,\nmanufacturing
        expenses not included in segment cost of sales, corporate\nmarketing expenses,
        and other separately managed general and administrative\nexpenses. The Company
        does not include intercompany transfers between segments\nfor management reporting
        purposes. Summary information by segment follows (in\nmillions):\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n

        9 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nIn March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement
        of Position (SOP) 98-1, \"Accounting\nfor the Costs of Computer Software Developed
        or Obtained for Internal Use,\"\nwhich provides guidance on accounting for
        the costs of computer software\nintended for internal use. The adoption of
        SOP 98-1 did not have a material\nimpact on the Company's consolidated results
        of operations or financial position\nduring the quarter and six-months ended
        April 1, 2000.\n\nIn June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        (SFAS) No. 133,\n\"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"
        was issued. SFAS\nNo. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for
        derivative\ninstruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS
        No. 133 requires\nan entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets
        or liabilities in the\nstatement of financial position and measure those instruments
        at fair value.\nDerivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
        through income.\nIf the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of
        the hedge, changes in\nfair value will either be offset against the change
        in fair value of the hedged\nassets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
        earnings, or recognized in\nother comprehensive income until the hedged item
        is recognized in earnings. In\nJune 1999, SFAS No. 137, \"Accounting for Derivative
        Instruments and Hedging\nActivities- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
        Statement No. 133\" was\nissued. The statement defers the effective date of
        SFAS No. 133 until the first\nquarter of fiscal 2001. Although the Company
        continues to review the effect of\nthe implementation of SFAS No. 133, the
        Company does not currently believe its\nadoption will have a material impact
        on its financial position or overall trends\nin results of operations and
        does not believe adoption will result in\nsignificant changes to its financial
        risk management practices. However, the\nimpact of adoption of SFAS No. 133
        on the Company's results of operations is\ndependent upon the fair values
        of the Company's derivatives and related\nfinancial instruments at the date
        of adoption and may result in more pronounced\nquarterly fluctuations in other
        income and expense.\n\nIn December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission
        issued Staff Accounting\nBulletin (SAB) No. 101, \"Revenue Recognition in
        Financial Statements.\" The\nobjective of this SAB is to provide further guidance
        on revenue recognition\nissues in the absence of authoritative literature
        addressing a specific\narrangement or a specific industry. The Company is
        required to follow the\nguidance in the SAB no later than the first quarter
        of its fiscal year 2001.\nAdoption of this guidance is not expected to have
        a material impact on the\nCompany's financial position or results of operations.
        The SEC has recently\nindicated it intends to issue further guidance with
        respect to adoption of\nspecific issues addressed by SAB No. 101. Until such
        time as this additional\nguidance is issued, the Company is unable to assess
        the impact, if any, it may\nhave on its financial position or results of operations.\n\n\n

        Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are\ndiscussed
        in detail in the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to\ncertain other
        legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary\ncourse of
        business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of\nlegal
        proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of\nmanagement,
        the Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal\nproceedings
        and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its\nfinancial condition
        or results of operations.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed
        federal income tax deficiencies\nfor the years 1984 through 1991, and the
        Company has made certain prepayments\nthereon. The Company contested the proposed
        deficiencies by filing petitions\nwith the United States Tax Court, and most
        of the issues in dispute have now\nbeen resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS
        proposed income tax adjustments for the\nyears 1992 through 1994. Although
        most of the issues for these years have been\nresolved, certain issues still
        remain in dispute and are being contested by the\nCompany. Management believes
        adequate provision has been made for any\nadjustments that may result from
        tax examinations.\n\nNOTE 11 - RECLASSIFICATIONS\n\nCertain amounts in the
        Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 25,\n1999, have been
        reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.\n\nNOTE 12 - SUBSEQUENT
        EVENTS\n\nOn April 19, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a
        two-for-one\nstock split, to be effected in the form of a stock dividend,
        subject to\nshareholder approval of an amendment to the Company's Restated
        Articles of\nIncorporation to increase the number of shares of Common Stock
        to 900,000,000.\nSuch approval was received at the Company's Annual Meeting
        of Shareholders held\non April 20, 2000. Shareholders of record on May 19,
        2000 will be entitled to\none additional share of common stock for each share
        of the Company's common\nstock held on that date. Share and per share data
        presented in this Form 10-Q\nhave not been adjusted to give effect to this

        $415 million or 27% to $1.945 billion in the second quarter\nof 2000 compared
        to the same quarter in 1999. The primary source of this growth\nwas an overall
        26% increase in Macintosh unit sales, which reflects strong unit\ngrowth in
        the Company's three largest geographic operating segments.\nApproximately
        half of the year-over-year increase in quarterly Macintosh unit\nshipments
        was attributable to sales of iBook, the Company's new education and\nconsumer
        oriented portable computer, which was not shipped until the fourth\nquarter
        of 1999. The average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total\nnet
        sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales,\nfor
        the second quarter of 2000 of $1,820 was comparable to the $1,813\nexperienced
        in the same quarter in 1999.\n\nFor the first six months of 2000, net sales
        increased $1.048 billion or 32% over\nthe same period in 1999. A 37% increase
        in year-to-date Macintosh unit sales,\nalso reflective of strong growth in
        the Company's three largest geographic\noperating segments, was the principal
        cause of the increase in net sales during\nthe first six months of 2000.\n\nNet
        sales declined sequentially during the second quarter of 2000 compared to\nthe
        first quarter of 2000 by $398 million or 17%. Similarly, Macintosh unit\nsales
        decreased 24% during the second quarter of 2000 compared to the first\nquarter.
        The sequential decline in both net sales and unit sales during the\nsecond
        quarter is consistent with the historical pattern experienced by the\nCompany
        due to lower demand in the Company's consumer markets following the\nholiday
        season. The sequential decrease in unit sales was somewhat offset by a\nsequential
        increase in the average revenue per Macintosh system, which rose from\n$1,673
        during the first quarter of 2000 to $1,820 during the second quarter. The\nincrease
        during the current quarter in the average revenue per Macintosh system\nis
        primarily attributable to the shift in the Company's unit mix towards\nhigher-priced
        professional oriented products such that Power Macintosh and\nPowerBook units
        comprised 44% of total Macintosh units sales during the second\nquarter of
        2000 versus 32% during the first quarter.\n\nSEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE\n\nThe
        Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's\nreportable
        geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, and Japan. The\nAmericas
        segment includes both North and South America. The European segment\nincludes
        European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan\nsegment
        includes only Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar\nhardware
        and software products and similar services. Further information\nregarding
        the Company's operating segments may be found in this Form 10-Q in the\nNotes
        to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8, \"Segment\nInformation
        and Geographic Data.\"\n\n\n                                       14\n\n<PAGE>\n\nAMERICAS\n\nNet
        sales in the Americas segment during the second quarter of 2000 increased\n$202
        million or 26% compared to the same period in 1999. Macintosh unit sales in\nthe
        Americas increased 29% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting strong growth\nin
        iMac unit sales and unit sales of the recently introduced iBook. During the\nsecond
        quarters of both 2000 and 1999, the Americas segment represented\napproximately
        51% of the Company's total net sales. The results experienced by\nthe Americas
        segment in the second quarter of 2000 versus the same quarter in\n1999 reflect
        the Company's overall results characterized by strong growth in\nunit sales
        and net sales of the Company's consumer and education oriented\nproducts and
        moderate growth in net sales of the Company's professional oriented\nproducts.\n\nEUROPE\n\nNet
        sales in the Europe segment increased $101 million or 27% during the second\nquarter
        of 2000 as compared to the same quarter in 1999, while the segment's\nMacintosh
        unit sales increased 35%. Like the Americas segment, Europe's results\nin
        the second quarter of 2000 as compared to 1999 are indicative of strong\ngrowth
        in Macintosh unit sales, particularly unit sales of iMac and iBook.\n\nJAPAN\n\nNet
        sales in Japan rose 33% or $87 million during the second quarter of 2000 as\ncompared
        to the same quarter in 1999 while Macintosh unit sales increased 12%.\nThe
        increase in net sales was primarily the result of increased unit sales of\nprofessional
        oriented products and iBook, partially offset by a moderate decline\nin unit
        sales of iMac.\n\nGROSS MARGIN\n\nGross margin for the second quarter of 2000
        was 28.2% compared to 26.3% for the\nsame quarter in 1999 and 25.9% for the
        first quarter of 2000. Gross margin\nduring the second quarter of 2000 was
        favorably impacted by three principal\nfactors. First, component costs were
        lower during the second quarter of 2000\ncompared to previous quarters. In
        particular, costs for DRAM fell close to\nlevels not experienced since the
        fourth quarter of 1999. Second, freight costs\ndeclined sequentially from
        the first quarter of 2000 because substantially\nhigher air freight costs
        were incurred during the first quarter of 2000 compared\nto the second quarter
        in order to get products introduced during the first\nquarter into the sales
        channel in time for the holiday selling season. Third,\nthe Company's overall
        product mix shifted towards higher-priced, higher margin\nprofessional products.
        Net sales of Power Macintosh and PowerBook products\naccounted for 48.2% of
        total net sales during the second quarter of 2000 and\n39.2% of net sales
        during the first quarter of 2000.\n\nThere can be no assurance targeted gross
        margin levels will be achieved or\ncurrent margins on existing individual
        products will be maintained. In general,\ngross margins and margins on individual
        products will remain under significant\ndownward pressure due to a variety
        of factors, including continued industry wide\nglobal pricing pressures, increased
        competition, compressed product life cycles,\npotential increases in the cost
        and availability of raw material and outside\nmanufacturing services, fluctuations
        in freight costs incurred to deliver the\nCompany's products to market, and
        potential changes to the Company's product\nmix, including higher unit sales
        of consumer products with lower average selling\nprices and lower gross margins.
        In response to these downward pressures, the\nCompany expects it will continue
        to take pricing actions with respect to its\nproducts. Gross margins could
        also be affected by the Company's ability to\neffectively manage quality problems
        and warranty costs and to stimulate demand\nfor certain of its products. The
        Company's operating strategy and pricing take\ninto account anticipated changes
        in foreign currency exchange rates over time;\nhowever, the Company's results
        of operations can be significantly affected in\nthe short term by fluctuations
        in exchange rates.\n\nOPERATING EXPENSES\n\nSelling, general and administrative
        expenses, excluding special charges,\nincreased $48 million or 20% during
        second quarter of 2000 as compared to the\nsame period in 1999 and decreased
        sequentially $32 million or 10% from the first\nquarter of 2000. The sequential
        decline from the first quarter of 2000 reflects\n\n                                       15\n<PAGE>\nthe
        typical seasonal decline in advertising and promotional activity associated\nwith
        the 1999 holiday season. Selling, general and administrative expenses for\nthe
        first six months of 2000 increased $88 million or 17% as compared to the\nsame
        period in 1999. However, as a result of growing net sales, selling, general\nand
        administrative expenses fell to 14% of net sales during the first six months\nof
        2000 compared to 16% during the same period in 1999. The absolute\nyear-over-year
        increases in selling, general and administrative expenses for\nboth the second
        quarter and the first six months of 2000 is the result of higher\nvariable
        selling and marketing expenses resulting from the year-over-year\nincrease
        in net sales and due to higher discretionary spending on marketing and\nadvertising
        in 2000 as compared to 1999.\n\nExpenditures for research and development
        increased 21% between the second\nquarter of fiscal 2000 and the same quarter
        in 1999 and increased 20% during the\nfirst six months of 2000 compared to
        the same period in 1999. These increases\nresulted primarily from increased
        spending in 2000 to support product\ndevelopment activities and increased
        research and development headcount.\n\nSPECIAL CHARGES\n\nDuring the first
        quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions\nresulting in
        recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was\ncomprised
        of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5\nmillion
        for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with\nconsolidation
        of various domestic and international sales and marketing\nfunctions. Of the
        $5 million accrued for severance, $1.7 million had been spent\nby April 1,
        2000, and the remainder is expected to be spent over the following\ntwo quarters.
        Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets,\nsubstantially
        all was utilized by April 1, 2000.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2000, the
        Company's Board of Directors approved a\nspecial executive bonus for the Company's
        Chief Executive Officer for past\nservices in the form of an aircraft with
        a total cost to the company of\napproximately $90 million, the majority of
        which is not tax deductible.\nApproximately half of the total charge is the
        cost of the aircraft. The other\nhalf represents all other costs and taxes
        associated with the purchase.\n\nTOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET\n\nInterest
        and other income and expense (net) increased $30 million or 158% to $49\nmillion
        during the second quarter of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999\nand
        increased $60 million or 207% for the first six months of 2000 over the same\nperiod
        in 1999. These increases are attributable to two factors. First, the\nCompany's
        cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were higher by\napproximately
        $687 million or 24% at the end of the second quarter of 2000\nversus the same
        balances at the end the second quarter of 1999. This resulted in\na $16 million
        or 48% increase in interest income between the second quarter of\n2000 and
        the second quarter of 1999 and an increase of $31 million or 48% for\nthe
        comparable six month periods. Second, as the result of conversion to common\nstock
        of the Company's convertible subordinated debentures during the third\nquarter
        of 1999, interest expense declined $10 million or 67% during the second\nquarter
        of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999 and decreased $21 million\nor
        68% for the comparable six month periods.\n\nDuring the second quarter of
        2000, the Company sold approximately 1.5 million\nshares of ARM stock for
        net proceeds of approximately $101 million and a gain\nbefore taxes of $100
        million. For the six-month period ended on April 1, 2000,\nthe Company sold
        approximately 6.7 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds\nof $237 million
        and a gain before taxes of $234 million. During the second\nquarter of 1999,
        the Company sold approximately 8.0 million shares of ARM stock\nfor net proceeds
        of approximately $59 million and a gain before taxes of $55\nmillion. For
        the six-month period ended on March 27, 1999, the Company sold\napproximately
        19.6 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $96 million\nand a gain
        before taxes of $87 million.\n\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nAs of April
        1, 2000, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible\ntemporary
        differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $580 million before being\noffset
        against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the\nCompany's
        balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based\non
        the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of April 1, 2000,\na
        valuation allowance of $45 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset\nfor
        the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance\n\n
        \                                      16\n<PAGE>\nprimarily relates to the
        operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to\ntax benefits in certain
        foreign jurisdictions. The Company will continue to\nevaluate the realizability
        of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the\nneed for and amount
        of the valuation allowance.\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the first
        quarter of 2000, was\napproximately 33% and includes the effect of the special
        executive bonus accrued\nduring that quarter. The effective tax rate during
        the first quarter of 2000\nwithout this charge was approximately 25%. The
        Company's effective tax rate for\nthe three months ended April 1, 2000, was
        approximately 27% which brings the\neffective tax rate without the special
        executive bonus for the six months ended\nApril 1, 2000, to 26%. This effective
        rate is less than the statutory federal\nincome tax rate of 35% due primarily
        to the reversal of a portion of the\npreviously established valuation allowance
        for tax loss and credit carryforwards\nand certain undistributed foreign earnings
        for which no U.S. taxes were\nprovided.\n\nTHE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES
        THAT ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF\n2000 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY
        26%. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS EFFECTIVE TAX\nRATE WILL INCREASE IN
        2001. THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THE\nCOMPANY'S ACTUAL
        RESULTS COULD DIFFER BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING\nTHOSE SET FORTH
        BELOW IN THE SUBSECTION ENTITLED \"FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE\nRESULTS
        AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\" ADDITIONALLY, THE ACTUAL FUTURE TAX RATE WILL\nBE
        SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE AMOUNT OF AND JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE\nCOMPANY'S
        FOREIGN PROFITS ARE EARNED.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nThe following

        and most recent quarterly cost of\n         sales adjusted for the change
        in inventory.\n\nAs of April 1, 2000, the Company had approximately $3.6 billion
        in cash, cash\nequivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $383
        million over the\nsame balances at the end of 1999. For the six months ended
        April 1, 2000, the\nCompany's primary source of cash was $434 million in cash
        flows from operating\nactivities. Cash generated by operations was primarily
        from net income of $416\nmillion and a combined increase in accounts payable
        and other current\nliabilities of $368 million partially offset by an increase
        in accounts\nreceivable of $259 million. In addition to operating cash flow,
        other\nsignificant cash flow items during the six months ended April 1, 2000
        included\nnet purchases of short-term investments of $47 million, $216 million
        utilized\nfor the purchase of long-term investments, $65 million for the purchase
        of\nproperty, plant and equipment, and cash proceeds from the sale of ARM
        stock of\n$237 million.\n\nIn July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors
        authorized a plan for the Company\nto repurchase up to $500 million of its
        common stock. This repurchase plan does\nnot obligate the Company to acquire
        any specific number of shares or acquire\nshares over any specified period
        of time. During the second quarter of 2000, no\nshares of common stock were
        repurchased. Since inception of the repurchase plan,\nthe Company has repurchased
        1.75 million shares at a cost of $116 million.\n\nOn November 18, 1999, the
        Company entered into a $100 million revolving credit\nagreement with Bank
        of America. Loans under the agreement pay interest at LIBOR\n\n                                       17\n<PAGE>\nplus
        1%, and the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.2% of the\nunused
        portion of the credit facility. No advances have been made against this\ncredit
        facility. This revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the\nCompany
        with an additional source of short-term liquidity.\n\nThe Company believes
        its balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments, and available
        credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its\ncash requirements over the
        next twelve months, including any cash that may be\nutilized by its stock
        repurchase plan. However, given the Company's current\nnon-investment grade
        debt ratings, if the Company should need to obtain\nshort-term borrowings,
        there can no assurance such borrowings could be\nobtained at favorable rates.
        The inability to obtain such borrowings at\nfavorable rates could materially
        adversely affect the Company's results of\noperations, financial condition,
        and liquidity.\n\nOTHER INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Company holds significant investments
        in ARM, Samsung, Akamai and\nEarthlink. These investments are reflected in
        the consolidated balances sheets\nas non-current debt and equity investments
        and have been categorized as\navailable-for-sale requiring that they be carried
        at fair value with\nunrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in
        equity as a component\nof accumulated other comprehensive income. The combined
        fair value of these\ninvestments was $1.544 billion and $339 million as of
        April 1, 2000, and\nSeptember 25, 1999, respectively. The combined fair value
        of these investments\nhas declined to approximately $1.215 billion as of May
        5, 2000. The Company\nbelieves it is likely there will continue to be significant
        fluctuations in\nthe fair value of these investments in the future. Additional
        information\nregarding these investment may be found in this Form 10-Q in
        the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 4, \"Non-Current
        Debt and\nEquity Investments.\"\n\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
        AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nThe Company operates in a rapidly changing environment
        that involves a number\nof uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's
        control. In addition\nto the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report,
        there are many\nfactors that will affect the Company's future results and
        business, which may\ncause the actual results to differ from those currently
        expected. The\nCompany's future operating results and financial condition
        is dependent upon\nthe Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture,
        and market\ntechnologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer
        demand\npatterns. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the
        Company\nmust successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating\nresults
        and a favorable financial condition.\n\nPotential risks and uncertainties
        that could affect the Company's future\noperating results and financial condition
        include, among other things,\ncontinued competitive pressures in the marketplace
        and the effect of any\nreaction by the Company to such competitive pressures,
        including pricing\nactions by the Company; risks associated with international
        operations,\nincluding economic and labor conditions, regional economic problems,
        political\ninstability, tax laws, and currency fluctuations; increasing dependence
        on\nthird-parties for manufacturing and other outsourced functions such as\nlogistics;
        the availability of key components on terms acceptable to the\nCompany; the
        continued availability of certain components and services\nessential to the
        Company's business currently obtained by the Company from\nsole or limited
        sources, including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by\nand obtained
        from IBM and Motorola and the final assembly of certain of the\nCompany's
        products; the Company's ability to supply products in certain\ncategories;
        the Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or\nother
        faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace\nof
        technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely\ndelivery
        of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely delivery of\nfuture
        versions of the Mac OS; the availability of third-party software for\nparticular
        applications; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain\nkey employees;
        the effect of previously undetected Y2K compliance issues;\nmanaging the continuing
        impact of the European Union's transition to the Euro\nas its common legal
        currency; continuing fluctuations in the fair value of the\nCompany's non-current
        debt and equity investments, and the Company's ability\nto retain the operational
        and cost benefits derived from its recently\ncompleted restructuring programs.\n\nFor
        a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future\nresults
        and financial condition, see \"Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and\nAnalysis
        -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\" in\nthe
        Company's 1999 Form 10-K.\n\n                                       18\n<PAGE>\n\nITEM
        3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nTHE INFORMATION
        PRESENTED BELOW REGARDING MARKET RISK CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING\nSTATEMENTS
        THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL\nRESULTS
        MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN\nTHIS
        FORM 10-Q REGARDING MARKET RISK. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN\nCONJUNCTION
        WITH THE 1999 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS
        AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q.\n\nThe Company's exposure
        to market risk for changes in interest rates relates\nprimarily to the Company's
        investments and long-term debt obligations and\nrelated derivative financial
        instruments. The Company places its investments\nwith high credit quality
        issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit\nexposure to any one issuer.
        The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of\nprincipal loss and ensure
        the safety of invested funds by limiting market and\ncredit risk. Excluding
        those investments classified as non-current debt and\nequity investments,
        all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three\nmonths or less at
        the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents;\ninvestments with
        maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be\nshort-term
        investments. As of April 1, 2000, substantially all of the Company's\ninvestments
        have maturities less than 12 months.\n\nDuring the last two years, the Company
        has entered into interest rate derivative\ntransactions, including interest
        rate swaps and floors, with financial\ninstitutions in order to better match
        the Company's floating-rate interest\nincome on its cash equivalents and short-term
        investments with its fixed-rate\ninterest expense on its long-term debt, and/or
        to diversify a portion of the\nCompany's exposure away from fluctuations in
        short-term U.S. interest rates. The\nCompany may also enter into interest
        rate contracts that are intended to reduce\nthe cost of the interest rate
        risk management program. The Company does not hold\nor transact in such financial
        instruments for purposes other than risk\nmanagement.\n\nOverall, the Company
        is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar\nand, as such,
        benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a\nstronger dollar
        relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange
        rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may\nnegatively
        affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.\ndollars.\n\nThe
        Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with\nfinancial
        institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks\nassociated
        with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions,
        and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company's\nforeign
        exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its\nexisting
        material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company\nmay
        not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial\neither
        in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of the related\ncurrency's
        historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange\nforward
        contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities. The\npremium
        costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in\nother
        current assets and marked to market through earnings.\n\nTo ensure the adequacy
        and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and\ninterest rate hedge
        positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities\nof the nonhedge
        portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign\nexchange forward
        and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and\nfloor positions
        both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its\nunderlying foreign
        currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively,\nfrom both an
        accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the\neffective horizons
        of the Company's risk management activities and the\nanticipatory nature of
        the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no\nassurance the aforementioned
        programs will offset more than a portion of the\nadverse financial impact
        resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign\nexchange or interest
        rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for\nrecognition of gains
        and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any\ngiven period may
        not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the\nunderlying
        economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's\noperating
        results and financial position.\n\n\n                                       19\n\n<PAGE>\n\nFor
        a complete description of the Company's interest rate and foreign\ncurrency
        related market risks, see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of the\nCompany's
        1999 Form 10-K. There has not been a material change in the\nCompany's exposure
        to interest rate and foreign currency risks since the date\nof the 1999 Form
        10-K.\n\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe Company
        is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are\ndiscussed in
        the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other\nlegal proceedings
        and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and which
        have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal\nproceedings cannot
        be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of\nmanagement, the Company
        does not have a potential liability related to any legal\nproceedings and
        claims that would have a material adverse effect on its\nfinancial condition
        or results of operations.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY

        a Committee designated by the Board, which Committee\nshall be constituted
        in such a manner as to satisfy the applicable securities\nlaws, California
        corporate law and the Code (collectively, \"APPLICABLE LAWS\").\n\n                     Once
        a Committee has been appointed pursuant to this\nSection 4(a), such Committee
        shall continue to serve in its designated capacity\nuntil otherwise directed
        by the Board.  From time to time the Board may increase\nthe size of the Committee
        and appoint additional members thereof, remove members\n(with or without cause)
        and appoint new members in substitution therefor, fill\nvacancies (however
        caused) and remove all members of the Committee and\nthereafter directly administer
        the Plan, all to the extent permitted by the\nApplicable Laws.\n\n              (b)
        \   POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Subject to the provisions of\nthe Plan and,
        in the case of the Committee, subject to the specific duties\ndelegated by
        the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the\nauthority,
        in its discretion:  (i) to determine the Fair Market Value of the\nCommon
        Stock in accordance with the Plan; (ii) to determine, in accordance with\nSection
        8(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per Share of Options and SARs to be\ngranted;
        (iii) to determine the Employees to whom, and the time or times at\nwhich,
        Options and SARs shall be granted and the number of Shares to be\nrepresented
        by each Option or SAR (including, without limitation, whether or not\na corporation
        shall be excluded\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\nfrom the definition of Affiliated Company);
        (iv) to construe and interpret\nthe provisions of the Plan and any agreements
        or certificates issued under or\nin connection with the Plan; (v) to determine
        the terms and conditions, not\ninconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of
        any Option or SAR granted\nhereunder (including, but not limited to, any restriction
        or limitation, or\nany vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions
        regarding any\nOption or SAR or the Shares relating thereto, based in each
        case on such\nfactors as the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion);
        (vi)\nto approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan; (vii) to prescribe,\namend
        and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (viii) to\nmodify
        or amend each Option or SAR or accelerate the exercise date of any\nOption
        or SAR; (ix) to reduce the exercise price of any Option or SAR to the\nthen
        current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock\ncovered
        by such Option or SAR shall have declined since the date the Option\nor SAR
        was granted; (x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the\nCompany
        any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Option or SAR\npreviously
        granted by the Administrator; and (xi) to make all other\ndeterminations deemed
        necessary or advisable for the administration of the\nPlan.\n\n              (c)
        \   EFFECT OF DECISIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATOR.  All decisions,\ndeterminations
        and interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and\nbinding on all
        Optionees and any other holders of any Options.\n\n       5.     ELIGIBILITY.
        \ The Administrator may grant Options and SARs only to\nindividuals who are
        Employees or who are consultants to the Company, or a\nSubsidiary or Affiliated
        Company.  In no event may an Option or SAR be granted\nto any individual who,
        at the time of grant, is an Officer or Director.  An\nEmployee who has been
        granted an Option or SAR may, if he or she is otherwise\neligible, be granted
        an additional Option or Options, SAR or SARs.  Each Option\nshall be evidenced
        by a written Option agreement, which shall be in such form\nand contain such
        provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem\nappropriate.
        \ Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrator may, at any\ntime, or
        from time to time, authorize the Company, with the consent of the\nrespective
        recipients, to issue new Options or Options in exchange for the\nsurrender
        and cancellation of any or all outstanding Options, other options,\nSARs or
        other stock appreciation rights.\n\n       Neither the Plan nor any Option
        or SAR agreement shall confer upon any\nOptionee any right with respect to
        continuation of employment by the Company (or\nany Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliated
        Company), nor shall it interfere in any way\nwith the Optionee's right or
        the right of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary\nor Affiliated Company)
        to terminate the Optionee's employment at any time or for\nany reason.\n\n
        \      If an Option or SAR is granted to an individual who is a consultant
        to\nthe Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, all references in the Plan
        to\n\"Employee\" shall be deemed to include the term \"consultant\" and all
        references\nin the Plan to \"employment,\" \"Continuous Status as an Employee\"
        and\n\"termination of employment\" shall be deemed to refer to the individual's\nconsultancy
        or status as a consultant.\n\n       6.     TERM OF PLAN.  The Plan shall
        become effective upon its adoption\nby the Board.  It shall continue in effect
        for a term of ten years unless sooner\nterminated under Section 14 of the
        Plan.\n\n       7.     TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be ten
        (10) years\nfrom the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be
        provided in the\nOption agreement.\n\n       8.     EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.\n\n
        \             (a)    EXERCISE PRICE.  The per Share exercise price for the\nShares
        issuable pursuant to an Option shall be such price as is determined by\nthe
        Administrator, but shall in no event be less than 100% of the Fair Market\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\nValue
        of Common Stock, determined as of the date of grant of the Option.  In\nthe
        event that the Administrator shall reduce the exercise price, the exercise\nprice
        shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of\nthat
        reduction.\n\n              (b)    METHOD OF PAYMENT.  The consideration to
        be paid for the\nShares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including
        the method of payment,\nshall be determined by the Administrator and may consist
        of (i) cash, (ii)\ncheck, (iii) promissory note, (iv) other Shares which have
        a Fair Market Value\non the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise
        price of the Shares as\nto which said Option shall be exercised, (v) delivery
        of a properly executed\nexercise notice together with irrevocable instructions
        to a broker to promptly\ndeliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan
        proceeds required to pay the\nexercise price, or (vi) any combination of the
        foregoing methods of payment\nand/or any other consideration or method of
        payment as shall be permitted under\napplicable corporate law.\n\n       9.
        \    STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.\n\n              (a)    GRANTED IN CONNECTION
        WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion\nof the Administrator, SARs may be granted
        in connection with all or any part of\nan Option, either concurrently with
        the grant of the Option or at any time\nthereafter during the term of the
        Option.  The following provisions apply to\nSARs that are granted in connection
        with Options:\n\n       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise
        the SAR by\n       surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the
        related Option.\n       The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company
        an amount equal\n       to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the
        date of exercise of the\n       SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered
        portion of the related\n       Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common
        Stock covered by the\n       surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding
        the\n       foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount that
        may be\n       paid upon exercise of an SAR; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
        limit shall\n       not restrict the exercisability of the related Option.\n\n
        \      (ii)   When an SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent\n
        \      surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable.\n\n       (iii)  An SAR
        shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the\n       related
        Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on\n       which
        the related Option expires.\n\n       (iv)   An SAR may only be exercised
        at a time when the Fair Market Value\n       of the Common Stock covered by
        the related Option exceeds the exercise\n       price of the Common Stock
        covered by the related Option.\n\n              (b)    INDEPENDENT SARS.  At
        the sole discretion of the\nAdministrator, SARs may be granted without related
        Options.  The following\nprovisions apply to SARs that are not granted in
        connection with Options:\n\n       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee,
        by exercising the SAR, to\n       receive from the Company an amount equal
        to the excess of (x) the Fair\n       Market Value of the Common Stock covered
        by exercised portion of the SAR,\n       as of the date of such exercise,
        over (y) the Fair Market Value of the\n       Common Stock covered by the
        exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date\n       on which the SAR was
        granted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrator\n       may place limits
        on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of an SAR.\n\n       (ii)   SARs
        shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as\n       the Administrator
        shall specify in the Optionee's SAR agreement.\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n              (c)
        \   FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the\nexercise
        of an SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination\nof
        Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may\ndetermine.
        \ Shares issued upon the exercise of an SAR shall be valued at their\nFair
        Market Value as of the date of exercise.\n\n       10.    METHOD OF EXERCISE.\n\n
        \             (a)    PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any\nOption
        or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under\nsuch
        conditions as determined by the Administrator and as shall be permissible\nunder
        the terms of the Plan.\n\n              An Option or SAR shall be deemed to
        be exercised when written\nnotice of such exercise has been given to the Company
        in accordance with the\nterms of the Option or SAR by the person entitled
        to exercise the Option or SAR\nand full payment for the Shares with respect
        to which the Option is exercised\nhas been received by the Company.  Full
        payment may, as authorized by the\nAdministrator and permitted by the Option
        agreement, consist of any\nconsideration and method of payment allowable under
        Section 8(b) of the Plan.\nUntil the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate
        entry on the books of the\nCompany or of a duly authorized transfer agent
        of the Company) of the stock\ncertificate evidencing such Shares, no right
        to vote or receive dividends or any\nother rights as a shareholder shall exist
        with respect to the Optioned Stock,\nnotwithstanding the exercise of the Option.
        \ No adjustment will be made for a\ndividend or other right for which the
        record date is prior to the date the stock\ncertificate is issued, except
        as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  An Option\nor SAR may not be exercised
        with respect to a fraction of a Share.\n\n              (b)    TERMINATION
        OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of\nan Optionee's Continuous Status
        as Employee (other than termination by reason of\nthe Optionee's death), the
        Optionee may, but only within ninety days after the\ndate of such termination,
        exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that\nit was exercisable at
        the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, however, an
        Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date the\nOption or SAR would
        otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time\nfrom the date of
        grant.\n\n              (c)    DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  In the event of the death
        of an\nOptionee:\n\n       (i)    Who is at the time of death an Employee
        and who shall have been in\n       Continuous Status as an Employee since
        the date of grant of the Option,\n       the Option or SAR may be exercised
        at any time within six (6) months (or\n       such other period of time not
        exceeding twelve (12) months as determined\n       by the Administrator) following
        the date of death by the Optionee's\n       estate or by a person who acquired
        the right to exercise the Option by\n       bequest or inheritance, but only
        to the extent of the right to exercise\n       that would have accrued had
        the Optionee continued living and terminated\n       his or her employment
        six (6) months (or such other period of time not\n       exceeding twelve
        (12) months as determined by the Administrator) after\n       the date of
        death; or\n\n       (ii)   Within ninety days after the termination of Continuous
        Status as\n       an Employee, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any
        time within six\n       (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding
        twelve (12) months\n       as determined by the Administrator) following the
        date of death by the\n       Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired
        the right to exercise the\n       Option by bequest or inheritance, but only
        to the extent of the right to\n       exercise that had accrued at the date
        of termination.\n\n              Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an
        Option or SAR may not\nbe exercised after the date the Option or SAR would
        otherwise expire by its\nterms due to the passage of time from the date of
        grant.\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n              (d)    STOCK WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING
        TAX OBLIGATIONS.\nWhen an Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with
        the exercise of an\nOption or SAR, which tax liability is subject to tax withholding
        under\napplicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay the Company
        an amount\nrequired to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the Optionee
        may satisfy the\nwithholding tax obligation (including, at the election of
        the Optionee, any\nadditional amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld
        in order to\nsatisfy in whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax
        in connection with\nthe exercise) by electing to have the Company withhold
        from the Shares to be\nissued upon exercise of the Option, or the Shares to
        be issued upon exercise of\nthe SAR, if any, that number of Shares having
        a Fair Market Value equal to the\namount required to be withheld (and any
        additional amount desired to be\nwithheld, as aforesaid).  The Fair Market
        Value of the Shares to be withheld\nshall be determined on the date that the
        amount of tax to be withheld is to be\ndetermined (the \"TAX DATE\").\n\n
        \             All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this\npurpose
        shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and\nshall
        be subject to the following restrictions:\n\n              (i)    the election
        must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax\nDate; and\n\n              (ii)
        \  all elections shall be subject to the consent or\ndisapproval of the Administrator.\n\n
        \      11.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS.  Options and SARs may not be
        sold,\npledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any
        manner other\nthan by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or pursuant
        to a\nqualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title I
        of the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder;
        PROVIDED,\nHOWEVER, that the Administrator may grant Nonstatutory Stock Options
        that are\nfreely transferable.  The designation of a beneficiary by an Optionee
        or holder\nof an SAR does not constitute a transfer.  An Option or an SAR
        may be exercised,\nduring the lifetime of the Optionee or SAR holder, only
        by the Optionee or SAR\nholder or by a transferee permitted by this Section
        11.\n\n       12.    ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION OR MERGER.\n\n
        \             (a)    CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action\nby
        the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each\noutstanding
        Option and SAR, and the number of Shares which have been authorized\nfor issuance
        under the Plan but as to which no Options or SARs have yet been\ngranted or
        which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration\nof an
        Option or SAR, as well as the price per Share covered by each such\noutstanding
        Option or SAR, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or\ndecrease
        in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse\nstock
        split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common\nStock,
        or any other increase or decrease in the aggregate number of issued\nShares
        effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; PROVIDED,\nHOWEVER,
        that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not\nbe
        deemed to have been \"effected without receipt of consideration.\"  Such\nadjustment
        shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination in that\nrespect shall
        be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided\nherein, no
        issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or\nsecurities convertible
        into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no\nadjustment by reason
        thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price\nof Shares subject
        to an Option or SAR.\n\n              (b)    DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In
        the event of the proposed\ndissolution or liquidation of the Company, all
        outstanding Options and SARs will\nterminate immediately prior to the consummation
        of such proposed action, unless\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\notherwise provided by the Administrator.
        \ The Administrator may, in the\nexercise of its sole discretion in such instances,
        declare that any Option or\nSAR shall terminate as of a date fixed by the
        Administrator and give each\nOptionee the right to exercise his or her Option
        or SAR as to all or any part\nof the Optioned Stock or SAR, including Shares
        as to which the Option or SAR\nwould not otherwise be exercisable.\n\n              (c)
        \   SALE OF ASSETS OR MERGER. Subject to the provisions of\nSection 12(d),
        in the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of\nthe assets
        of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another\ncorporation,
        each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent\noption
        or stock appreciation right shall be substituted by such successor\ncorporation
        or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the\nAdministrator
        determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of\nsuch assumption
        or substitution, that the Optionee shall have the right to\nexercise the Option
        or SAR as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as\nto which the
        Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.  If the\nAdministrator makes
        an Option or SAR fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or\nsubstitution
        in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Company shall\nnotify the
        Optionee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a\nperiod of
        thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR\nwill
        terminate upon the expiration of such period.  For purposes of this\nparagraph,
        an Option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed if,\nfollowing
        the sale of assets or merger, the Option confers the right to\npurchase, for
        each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately\nprior to the
        sale of assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or\nother
        securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by\nholders
        of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the\ntransaction
        (and if such holders were offered a choice of consideration, the\ntype of
        consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding\nShares);
        provided, however, that if such consideration received in the sale of\nassets
        or merger was not solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or its\nparent,
        the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation and\nthe
        participant, provide for the per share consideration to be received upon\nexercise
        of te Option to be solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or\nits
        parent equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received
        by\nholders of Common Stock in the sale of assets or merger.\n\n              (d)
        \   CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a \"Change in Control\"\nof the Company,
        as defined in Section 12(e), unless otherwise determined by the\nAdministrator
        prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following\nacceleration
        and valuation provisions shall apply:\n\n       (i)    Any Options and SARs
        outstanding as of the date such Change in\n       Control is determined to
        have occurred that are not yet exercisable and\n       vested on such date
        shall become fully exercisable and vested; and\n\n       (ii)   The value
        of all outstanding Options and SARs shall, unless\n       otherwise determined
        by the Administrator at or after grant, be\n       cashed-out.  The amount
        at which such Options and SARs shall be cashed\n       out shall be equal
        to the excess of (x) the Change in Control Price (as\n       defined below)
        over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by\n       the Option
        or SAR.  The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee\n       or, in

        deemed necessary or advisable\n       for administering the Plan.\n\n        (c)
        \ EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATOR'S DECISION.  The Administrator's decisions,\n    determinations
        and interpretations shall be final and binding on all\n    Optionees and any
        other holders of Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights.\n\n    5.  ELIGIBILITY.
        \ Nonstatutory Stock Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights\nmay be granted
        to the Chairman, Executive Officers and other key employees or to\nsuch other
        individuals as determined by the Administrator whom the Company has\noffered
        a position of Chairman or Executive Officer. Incentive Stock Options may\nbe
        granted only to Executive Officers and other key employees.\n\n    6.  LIMITATIONS.\n\n
        \       (a) Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement as either an\n
        \   Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,\n    notwithstanding
        such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair\n    Market Value
        of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are\n    exercisable
        for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year\n    (under all
        plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds\n    $100,000,
        such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For\n    purposes
        of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into\n    account
        in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of\n    the
        Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to\n    such
        Shares is granted.\n\n        (b) Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or
        Stock Purchase Right shall\n    confer upon an Optionee any right with respect
        to continuing the Optionee's\n    relationship as an Employee with or Chairman
        of the Company, nor shall they\n    interfere in any way with the Optionee's
        right or the Company's right to\n    terminate such relationship at any time,
        with or without cause.\n\n        (c) The following limitations shall apply
        to grants of Options and SARs:\n\n           (i) No participant shall be granted,
        in any fiscal year of the\n       Company, Options or SARs to purchase more
        than 17,000,000 Shares;\n\n           (ii) The foregoing limitations shall
        be adjusted proportionately in\n       connection with any change in the Company's
        capitalization as described\n       in Section 15;\n\n          (iii) If an
        Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the\n       Company in
        which it was granted (other than in connection with a\n       transaction
        described in Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted\n       against
        the limits set forth in subsections (i) above. For this purpose,\n       if
        the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction\n       will
        be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR and the grant of a\n       new
        Option or SAR.\n\n    7.  TERM OF PLAN.  Subject to Section 21 of the Plan,
        the Plan shall become\neffective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall
        continue in effect for a term\nof ten (10) years unless terminated earlier
        under Section 16 of the Plan.\n\n    8.  TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each
        Option shall be stated in the\nAgreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock
        Option, the term shall be ten (10)\nyears from the date of grant or such shorter
        term as may be provided in the\nAgreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive
        Stock Option granted to an\nOptionee who, at the time the Incentive Stock
        Option is granted, owns stock\nrepresenting more than ten percent (10%) of
        the total combined voting power of\nall classes of stock of the Company or
        any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the\nIncentive Stock Option shall be
        five (5) years from the date of grant or such\nshorter term as may be provided
        in the Agreement.\n\n<PAGE>\n    9.  OPTION EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.\n\n
        \       (a)  EXERCISE PRICE.  The per share exercise price for the Shares
        to be\n    issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by
        the\n    Administrator, subject to the following:\n\n           (i) In the
        case of an Incentive Stock Option;\n\n              (A) granted to an Employee
        who, at the time the Incentive Stock\n           Option is granted, owns stock
        representing more than ten percent\n           (10%) of the voting power of
        all classes of stock of the Company or\n           any Parent or Subsidiary,
        the per Share exercise price shall be no\n           less than 110% of the
        Fair Market Value per Share on the date of\n           grant; or\n\n               (B)
        granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in\n           paragraph
        (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall\n           be no
        less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date\n           of
        grant;\n\n           (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the
        per Share\n       exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator.
        In the case of a\n       Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as
        'performance-based\n       compensation' within the meaning of Section 162(m)
        of the Code, the per\n       Share exercise price shall be no less than 100%
        of the Fair Market Value\n       per Share on the date of grant;\n\n          (iii)
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per\n       Share
        exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share\n       on
        the date of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a\n       merger
        or other corporate transaction.\n\n        (b)  WAITING PERIOD AND EXERCISE
        DATES.  At the time an Option is\n    granted, the Administrator shall fix
        the period within which the Option may\n    be exercised and shall determine
        any conditions which must be satisfied\n    before the Option may be exercised.\n\n
        \       (c)  FORM OF CONSIDERATION.  The Administrator shall determine the\n
        \   acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the\n
        \   method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the\n    Administrator
        shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the\n    time of grant.
        Such consideration may consist entirely of:\n\n           (i) cash;\n\n           (ii)
        check;\n\n          (iii) promissory note;\n\n           (iv) other Shares
        which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon\n       exercise of an option,
        have been owned by the Optionee for more than six\n       months on the date
        of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the\n       date of surrender
        equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as\n       to which said
        Option shall be exercised;\n\n           (v) consideration received by the
        Company under a cashless exercise\n       program implemented by the Company
        in connection with the Plan;\n\n           (vi) a reduction in the amount
        of any Company liability to the\n       Optionee, including any liability
        attributable to the Optionee's\n       participation in any Company-sponsored
        deferred compensation program or\n       arrangement;\n\n          (vii) any
        combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or\n\n         (viii) such
        other consideration and method of payment for the issuance\n       of Shares
        to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.\n\n<PAGE>\n    10.  STOCK APPRECIATION
        RIGHTS.\n\n        (a)  GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion
        of the\n    Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any
        part of an\n    Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or
        at any time\n    thereafter during the term of the Option. The following provisions
        apply to\n    SARs that are granted in connection with Options:\n\n           (i)
        The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by\n       surrendering
        to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.\n       The Optionee
        shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal\n       to the
        excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the\n       SAR
        of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related\n       Option
        over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the\n       surrendered
        portion of the related Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\n       the
        Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon\n       exercise
        of a SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict\n       the
        exercisability of the related Option;\n\n           (ii) When a SAR is exercised,
        the related Option, to the extent\n       surrendered, shall no longer be
        exercisable;\n\n          (iii) A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to
        the extent that the\n       related Option is exercisable and shall expire
        no later than the date on\n       which the related Option expires; and\n\n
        \          (iv) A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market
        Value\n       of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the
        exercise\n       price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.\n\n
        \       (b)  INDEPENDENT SARS.  At the sole discretion of the Administrator,\n
        \   SARs may be granted without related Options. The following provisions
        apply\n    to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:\n\n           (i)
        The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to\n       receive
        from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair\n       Market
        Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,\n       as
        of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the\n       Common
        Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date\n       on
        which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the Administrator\n       may
        place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of a SAR;\n       and\n\n
        \          (ii) SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times
        as\n       the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's Agreement.\n\n
        \       (c)  FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the\n
        \   exercise of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any\n
        \   combination of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole\n
        \   discretion, may determine. Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR shall
        be\n    valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.\n\n
        \       (d)  RULE 16b-3.  SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional\n
        \   restrictions as may be required to be contained in the Plan or Agreement
        in\n    order for the SAR to qualify for the maximum exemption provided by
        Rule\n    16b-3.\n\n    11.  EXERCISE OF OPTION OR SAR.\n\n        (a)  PROCEDURE
        FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any Option or SAR\n    granted hereunder
        shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan\n    and at such times
        and under such conditions as determined by the\n    Administrator and set
        forth in the Agreement. An Option may not be exercised\n    for a fraction
        of a Share.\n\n<PAGE>\n        An Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised
        when the Company receives:\n    (i) written or electronic notice of exercise
        (in accordance with the terms\n    of the Option or SAR) from the person entitled
        to exercise the Option or\n    SAR, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with
        respect to which the Option\n    is exercised. Full payment may consist of
        any consideration and method of\n    payment authorized by the Administrator
        and permitted by the Agreement and\n    the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise
        of an Option shall be issued in the\n    name of the Optionee or, if requested
        by the Optionee, in the name of the\n    Optionee and his or her spouse. Until
        the Shares are issued (as evidenced by\n    the appropriate entry on the books
        of the Company or of a duly authorized\n    transfer agent of the Company),
        no right to vote or receive dividends or any\n    other rights as a shareholder
        shall exist with respect to the Optioned\n    Stock, notwithstanding the exercise
        of the Option. The Company shall issue\n    (or cause to be issued) such Shares
        promptly after the Option is exercised.\n    No adjustment will be made for
        a dividend or other right for which the\n    record date is prior to the date
        the Shares are issued, except as provided\n    in Section 15 of the Plan.\n\n
        \       Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares\n
        \   thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under
        the\n    Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.\n
        \   Exercise of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised,\n
        \   result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be\n
        \   available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be\n    exercisable
        to the extent it has been exercised.\n\n        (b)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS
        STATUS AS CHAIRMAN.  Upon termination of\n    an Optionee's Continuous Status
        as Chairman (other than termination by\n    reason of the Optionee's death),
        the Optionee may, but only within\n    ninety (90) days after the date of
        such termination, exercise his or her\n    Option or SAR to the extent that
        it was exercisable at the date of such\n    termination. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may\n    not be exercised after the date
        the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by\n    its terms due to the passage
        of time from the date of grant.\n\n        (c)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS
        EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of an\n    Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee
        (other than termination by reason\n    of the Optionee's death), the Optionee
        may, but only within ninety (90) days\n    after the date of such termination,
        exercise his or her Option or SAR to the\n    extent that it was exercisable
        at the date of such termination.\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
        an Option or SAR may not be\n    exercised after the date the Option or SAR
        would otherwise expire by its\n    terms due to the passage of time from the
        date of grant.\n\n        (d)  DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  If an Optionee dies (i)
        while an Employee or\n    Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at
        any time within six (6)\n    months (or such other period of time not exceeding
        twelve (12) months as\n    determined by the Administrator) following the
        date of death by the\n    Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the
        right to exercise the\n    Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the
        extent of the right to\n    exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee
        continued living and\n    terminated his or her employment six (6) months
        (or such other period of\n    time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined
        by the Administrator)\n    after the date of death; or (ii) within ninety
        (90) days after the\n    termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or
        Chairman, the Option or\n    SAR may be exercised, at any time within six
        (6) months (or such other\n    period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months
        as determined by the\n    Administrator) following the date of death by the
        Optionee's estate or by a\n    person who acquired the right to exercise the
        Option or SAR by bequest or\n    inheritance, but only to the extent of the
        right to exercise that had\n    accrued at the date of termination. If the
        Option or SAR is not so exercised\n    within the time specified herein, the
        Option or SAR shall terminate, and the\n    Shares covered by such Option
        or SAR shall revert to the Plan.\n\n        Notwithstanding the foregoing,
        however, an Option or SAR may not be\n    exercised after the date the Option
        or SAR would otherwise expire by its\n    terms due to the passage of time
        from the date of grant.\n\n<PAGE>\n        (e)  BUYOUT PROVISIONS.  The Administrator
        may at any time offer to buy\n    out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option
        or SAR previously granted\n    based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator
        shall establish and\n    communicate to the Optionee at the time that such
        offer is made.\n\n    12.  STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.\n\n        (a)  RIGHTS TO
        PURCHASE.  Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either\n    alone, in addition
        to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan\n    and/or cash
        awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator\n    determines that
        it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall\n    advise the
        Optionee in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions\n    and restrictions
        related to the offer, including the number of Shares that\n    the Optionee
        shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the\n    time within
        which the Optionee must accept such offer. The offer shall be\n    accepted
        by execution of an Agreement in the form determined by the\n    Administrator.\n\n
        \       (b)  REPURCHASE OPTION.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise,\n
        \   the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable
        upon\n    the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service
        with the\n    Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The
        purchase price\n    for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall
        be the original price\n    paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation
        of any indebtedness of\n    the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option
        shall lapse at a rate\n    determined by the Administrator.\n\n        (c)
        \ OTHER PROVISIONS.  The Agreement shall contain such other terms,\n    provisions
        and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be\n    determined by
        the Administrator in its sole discretion.\n\n        (d)  RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.
        \ Once the Stock Purchase Right is\n    exercised, the purchaser shall have
        the rights equivalent to those of a\n    shareholder, and shall be a shareholder
        when his or her purchase is entered\n    upon the records of the duly authorized
        transfer agent of the Company. No\n    adjustment will be made for a dividend
        or other right for which the record\n    date is prior to the date the Stock
        Purchase Right is exercised, except as\n    provided in Section 15 of the
        Plan.\n\n    13.  TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS, SARS AND STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.
        \ Unless\ndetermined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock
        Purchase\nRight may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred,
        or disposed\nof in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent
        or distribution or\npursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined
        by the Code or Title\n1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and
        may be exercised, during\nthe lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.
        If the Administrator makes\nan Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right transferable,
        such Option, SAR or Stock\nPurchase Right shall contain such additional terms
        and conditions as the\nAdministrator deems appropriate.\n\n    14.  STOCK
        WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAX OBLIGATIONS.  When an\nOptionee incurs
        tax liability in connection with the exercise of an Option, SAR\nor Stock
        Purchase Right, which tax liability is subject to tax withholding under\napplicable
        tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay the Company an amount\nrequired
        to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may satisfy the\nwithholding
        tax obligation (including, at the election of the Optionee, any\nadditional
        amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld in order to\nsatisfy in
        whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax in connection with\nthe
        exercise) by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be\nissued
        upon exercise of the Option, or the Shares to be issued upon exercise of\nthe
        SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if any, that number of Shares having a Fair\nMarket
        Value equal to the amount required to be withheld (and any additional\namount
        desired to be withheld, as aforesaid). The Fair Market Value of the\nShares
        to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to\nbe
        withheld is to be determined (the \"Tax Date\").\n\n    All elections by an
        Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall\nbe made in writing
        in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall be\nsubject to the following
        restrictions:\n\n        (i) the election must be made on or prior to the
        applicable Tax Date;\n    and\n\n<PAGE>\n        (ii) all elections shall
        be subject to the consent or disapproval of the\n    Administrator.\n\n    In
        the event the election to have Shares withheld is made by an Optionee and\nthe
        Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 of the Code because no election is\nfiled
        under Section 83(b) of the Code, the Optionee shall receive the full\nnumber
        of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right\nis
        exercised but such Optionee shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back\nto
        the Company the proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.\n\n    15.  ADJUSTMENTS
        UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, DISSOLUTION, MERGER OR\nASSET SALE.\n\n        (a)
        \ CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action by the\n    shareholders
        of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by\n    each
        outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of\n    shares
        of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the\n    Plan
        but as to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been\n
        \   granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or\n
        \   expiration of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price\n
        \   per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR
        or\n    Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase
        or\n    decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting
        from a\n    stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination
        or\n    reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease
        in\n    the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt
        of\n    consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of
        any\n    convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have
        been\n    \"effected without receipt of consideration.\" Such adjustment shall
        be made\n    by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final,
        binding\n    and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance
        by the\n    Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible
        into\n    shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by
        reason\n    thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of
        shares of\n    Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.\n\n
        \       (b)  DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In the event of the proposed\n    dissolution
        or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options, SARs and\n    Stock
        Purchase Rights will terminate immediately prior to the consummation\n    of
        such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. The\n
        \   Administrator may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances,\n
        \   declare that any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate as
        of a\n    date fixed by the Administrator and give each Optionee the right
        to exercise\n    his or her Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all
        or any part of the\n    Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option,
        SAR or Stock\n    Purchase Right would not otherwise be exercisable.\n\n        (c)
        \ MERGER OR ASSET SALE.  Unless otherwise determined by the\n    Administrator,
        in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another\n    corporation,
        or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company,\n    each outstanding
        Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right shall be assumed or an\n    equivalent
        option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a\n    Parent
        or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the\n    successor
        corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, SAR or\n    Stock
        Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to\n    exercise
        the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned\n    Stock,
        including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or\n    exercisable.
        If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested\n    and exercisable
        in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a\n    merger or sale
        of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in\n    writing or
        electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall\n    be
        fully vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the\n    date
        of such notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall\n    terminate
        upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this\n    paragraph,
        the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered\n    assumed if,
        following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right\n    confers the
        right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock\n    subject
        to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the\n    merger
        or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other\n\n<PAGE>\n\n
        \   securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by\n
        \   holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the\n
        \   transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the\n
        \   type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the\n    outstanding
        Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration\n    received in the
        merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the\n    succesor corporation
        or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the\n    consent of the successor
        corporation, provide for the consideration to be\n    received upon the exercise
        of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for\n    each Share of Optioned
        Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase\n    Right, to be solely
        common stock of the successor corporation or its\n    Parent equal in fair
        market value to the per share consideration received\n    by holders of Common
        Stock in the merger or sale of assets.\n\n        (d)  CHANGE IN CONTROL.
        \ In the event of a \"Change in Control\" of the\n    Company, as defined
        in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise determined by\n    the Administrator
        prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the\n    following acceleration
        and valuation provisions shall apply:\n\n           (i) Any Options, SARs
        and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding as of the\n       date such Change in
        Control is determined to have occurred that are not\n       yet exercisable
        and vested on such date shall become fully exercisable\n       and vested;
        and\n\n          (ii) The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock
        Purchase\n       Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator
        at or\n       after grant, be cashed-out. The amount at which such Options,
        SARs and\n       Stock Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal
        to the excess of\n       (x) the Change in Control Price (as defined below)
        over (y) the exercise\n       price of the Common Stock covered by the Option,
        SAR or Stock Purchase\n       Right. The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to
        the Optionee or, in the\n       event of death of an Optionee prior to payment,
        to the estate of the\n       Optionee or to a person who acquired the right
        to exercise the Option,\n       SAR or Stock Purchase Right by bequest or
        inheritance.\n\n        (e)  DEFINITION OF \"CHANGE IN CONTROL\".  For purposes
        of this\n    Section 15, a \"Change in Control\" means the happening of any
        of the\n    following:\n\n           (i) When any \"person\", as such term
        is used in Sections 13(d) and\n       14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than
        the Company, a Subsidiary or a\n       Company employee benefit plan, including
        any trustee of such plan acting\n       as trustee) is or becomes the \"beneficial
        owner\" (as defined in\n       Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly
        or indirectly, of securities\n       of the Company representing fifty percent
        (50%) or more of the combined\n       voting power of the Company's then outstanding
        securities; or\n\n           (ii) The occurrence of a transaction requiring
        shareholder approval,\n       and involving the sale of all or substantially
        all of the assets of the\n       Company or the merger of the Company with
        or into another corporation.\n\n        (f)  CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For
        purposes of this Section 15, \"Change\n    in Control Price\" shall be, as
        determined by the Administrator, (i) the\n    highest Fair Market Value at
        any time within the 60-day period immediately\n    preceding the date of determination
        of the Change in Control Price by the\n    Administrator (the \"60-Day Period\"),
        or (ii) the highest price paid or\n    offered, as determined by the Administrator,
        in any bona fide transaction or\n    bona fide offer related to the Change
        in Control of the Company, at any time\n    within the 60-Day Period.\n\n
        \   16.  DATE OF GRANT.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase\nRight
        shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the\ndetermination
        granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or such other\nlater date
        as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination\nshall
        be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of\nsuch
        grant.\n\n<PAGE>\n    17.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.\n\n        (a)
        \ AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time amend, alter,\n    suspend
        or terminate the Plan.\n\n        (b)  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  The Company
        shall obtain shareholder\n    approval of any Plan amendment to the extent
        necessary and desirable to\n    comply with Applicable Laws.\n\n        (c)
        \ EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.  No amendment, alteration,\n    suspension
        or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any\n    Optionee, unless
        mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the\n    Administrator,
        which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee\n    and the
        Company. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the\n    Administrator's
        ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with\n    respect to
        Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights granted under the Plan\n    prior to
        the date of such termination.\n\n    18.  CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.\n\n
        \       (a)  LEGAL COMPLIANCE.  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the\n
        \   exercise of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right unless the exercise
        of\n    such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right and the issuance and delivery
        of\n    such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further
        subject\n    to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such
        compliance.\n\n        (b)  INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS.  As a condition to
        the exercise of an\n    Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, the Company may
        require the person\n    exercising such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right
        to represent and warrant\n    at the time of any such exercise that the Shares
        are being purchased only\n    for investment and without any present intention
        to sell or distribute such\n    Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the
        Company, such a representation\n    is required.\n\n    19.  INABILITY TO
        OBTAIN AUTHORITY.  The inability of the Company to obtain\nauthority from
        any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is\ndeemed by the
        Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale\nof any
        Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect\nof
        the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority\nshall
        not have been obtained.\n\n    20.  RESERVATION OF SHARES.  The Company, during
        the term of this Plan, will\nat all times reserve and keep available such
        number of Shares as shall be\nsufficient to satisfy the requirements of the
        Plan.\n\n    21.  SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.  The Plan shall be subject to approval
        by the\nshareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date

        employee who is resident outside of the United\nStates, the Committee may,
        in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the\nPlan in order to conform such
        terms with the requirements of local law or to\nmeet the objectives of the
        Plan. The Committee may, where appropriate,\nestablish one or more sub-plans
        for this purpose.\n\n</TEXT>\n</DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>\n<TYPE>EX-27\n<SEQUENCE>5\n<DESCRIPTION>EX

        Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nNOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
        AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nInterim information is unaudited;
        however, in the opinion of the Company's\nmanagement, all adjustments of a
        normal recurring nature necessary for a fair\nstatement of interim periods
        presented have been included. The results for\ninterim periods are not necessarily
        indicative of results to be expected for the\nentire year. These condensed
        consolidated financial statements and accompanying\nnotes should be read in
        conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and
        the notes thereto for the year ended September 25,\n1999, included in its
        Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September\n25, 1999 (the 1999
        Form 10-K). All information is based on the Company's fiscal\ncalendar.\n\nNOTE
        2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing
        income available to common\nshareholders by the weighted-average number of
        shares of common stock\noutstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
        share is computed by\ndividing income available to common shareholders by
        the weighted-average number\nof shares of common stock outstanding during
        the period increased to include the\nnumber of additional common shares that
        would have been outstanding if dilutive\npotential common shares had been
        issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding\noptions is reflected in diluted
        earnings per share by application of the\ntreasury stock method. The dilutive
        effect of convertible securities is\nreflected using the if-converted method.\n\nThe
        following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per\nshare
        (in thousands, except net income and per share amounts):\n\n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n

        to purchase approximately 209,750 and 253,000 shares of common stock\nwere
        outstanding as of April 1, 2000, and March 27, 1999, respectively, that\nwere
        not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for these\nquarters
        because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market\nprice
        of the Company's common stock during those periods and, therefore, the\neffect
        would be antidilutive.\n\nDuring the first two quarters of 1999, the Company
        had outstanding $661 million\nof unsecured convertible subordinated debentures
        (the Debentures) which were\nconvertible by their holders into approximately
        22.6 million shares of common\nstock at a conversion price of $29.205 per
        share. The weighted average common\nshares represented by the Debentures upon
        conversion were included in the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per share
        for the three and six month periods\nended March 27, 1999, using the if-converted
        method. On April 14, 1999, the\nCompany called for redemption the Debentures.
        As a result, debenture holders\nconverted virtually all of the outstanding
        debentures to 22.6 million shares of\nthe Company's common stock in 1999.

        Co., Ltd (Samsung), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai) and EarthLink\nNetwork,
        Inc. (EarthLink). These investments are reflected in the consolidated\nbalance
        sheets as non-current debt and equity investments and have been\ncategorized
        as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value\nwith unrealized
        gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a\ncomponent of accumulated
        other comprehensive income. The combined fair value of\nthese investments
        was $1.544 billion and $339 million as of April 1, 2000, and\nSeptember 25,
        1999, respectively. The combined fair value of these investments\nhas declined
        to approximately $1.215 billion as of May 5, 2000. The Company\nbelieves it

        value of these investments in the future.\n\nARM is a publicly held company
        in the United Kingdom involved in the design and\nlicensing of high performance
        microprocessors and related technology. As of\nSeptember 25, 1999, the Company

        million. During the first quarter of 2000, the\nCompany sold approximately
        5.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of\napproximately $136 million

        9 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nIn March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement
        of Position (SOP) 98-1, \"Accounting\nfor the Costs of Computer Software Developed
        or Obtained for Internal Use,\"\nwhich provides guidance on accounting for
        the costs of computer software\nintended for internal use. The adoption of
        SOP 98-1 did not have a material\nimpact on the Company's consolidated results
        of operations or financial position\nduring the quarter and six-months ended
        April 1, 2000.\n\nIn June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        (SFAS) No. 133,\n\"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"
        was issued. SFAS\nNo. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for
        derivative\ninstruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS
        No. 133 requires\nan entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets
        or liabilities in the\nstatement of financial position and measure those instruments
        at fair value.\nDerivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
        through income.\nIf the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of
        the hedge, changes in\nfair value will either be offset against the change
        in fair value of the hedged\nassets, liabilities, or firm commitments through
        earnings, or recognized in\nother comprehensive income until the hedged item
        is recognized in earnings. In\nJune 1999, SFAS No. 137, \"Accounting for Derivative
        Instruments and Hedging\nActivities- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
        Statement No. 133\" was\nissued. The statement defers the effective date of
        SFAS No. 133 until the first\nquarter of fiscal 2001. Although the Company
        continues to review the effect of\nthe implementation of SFAS No. 133, the
        Company does not currently believe its\nadoption will have a material impact
        on its financial position or overall trends\nin results of operations and
        does not believe adoption will result in\nsignificant changes to its financial
        risk management practices. However, the\nimpact of adoption of SFAS No. 133
        on the Company's results of operations is\ndependent upon the fair values
        of the Company's derivatives and related\nfinancial instruments at the date
        of adoption and may result in more pronounced\nquarterly fluctuations in other
        income and expense.\n\nIn December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission
        issued Staff Accounting\nBulletin (SAB) No. 101, \"Revenue Recognition in
        Financial Statements.\" The\nobjective of this SAB is to provide further guidance
        on revenue recognition\nissues in the absence of authoritative literature
        addressing a specific\narrangement or a specific industry. The Company is
        required to follow the\nguidance in the SAB no later than the first quarter
        of its fiscal year 2001.\nAdoption of this guidance is not expected to have
        a material impact on the\nCompany's financial position or results of operations.
        The SEC has recently\nindicated it intends to issue further guidance with
        respect to adoption of\nspecific issues addressed by SAB No. 101. Until such
        time as this additional\nguidance is issued, the Company is unable to assess
        the impact, if any, it may\nhave on its financial position or results of operations.\n\n\n
        \                                      11\n\n<PAGE>\n\nNOTE 10 - CONTINGENCIES\n\nThe
        Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that are\ndiscussed
        in detail in the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to\ncertain other
        legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary\ncourse of
        business and which have not been fully adjudicated. The results of\nlegal
        proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of\nmanagement,
        the Company does not have a potential liability related to any legal\nproceedings
        and claims that would have a material adverse effect on its\nfinancial condition
        or results of operations.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed
        federal income tax deficiencies\nfor the years 1984 through 1991, and the
        Company has made certain prepayments\nthereon. The Company contested the proposed
        deficiencies by filing petitions\nwith the United States Tax Court, and most
        of the issues in dispute have now\nbeen resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS
        proposed income tax adjustments for the\nyears 1992 through 1994. Although
        most of the issues for these years have been\nresolved, certain issues still
        remain in dispute and are being contested by the\nCompany. Management believes
        adequate provision has been made for any\nadjustments that may result from
        tax examinations.\n\nNOTE 11 - RECLASSIFICATIONS\n\nCertain amounts in the
        Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 25,\n1999, have been
        reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.\n\nNOTE 12 - SUBSEQUENT
        EVENTS\n\nOn April 19, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a
        two-for-one\nstock split, to be effected in the form of a stock dividend,
        subject to\nshareholder approval of an amendment to the Company's Restated
        Articles of\nIncorporation to increase the number of shares of Common Stock
        to 900,000,000.\nSuch approval was received at the Company's Annual Meeting
        of Shareholders held\non April 20, 2000. Shareholders of record on May 19,
        2000 will be entitled to\none additional share of common stock for each share
        of the Company's common\nstock held on that date. Share and per share data
        presented in this Form 10-Q\nhave not been adjusted to give effect to this
        stock split.\n\n                                       12\n\n<PAGE>\n\n\nITEM

        $415 million or 27% to $1.945 billion in the second quarter\nof 2000 compared
        to the same quarter in 1999. The primary source of this growth\nwas an overall
        26% increase in Macintosh unit sales, which reflects strong unit\ngrowth in
        the Company's three largest geographic operating segments.\nApproximately
        half of the year-over-year increase in quarterly Macintosh unit\nshipments
        was attributable to sales of iBook, the Company's new education and\nconsumer
        oriented portable computer, which was not shipped until the fourth\nquarter
        of 1999. The average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total\nnet
        sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales,\nfor
        the second quarter of 2000 of $1,820 was comparable to the $1,813\nexperienced
        in the same quarter in 1999.\n\nFor the first six months of 2000, net sales
        increased $1.048 billion or 32% over\nthe same period in 1999. A 37% increase
        in year-to-date Macintosh unit sales,\nalso reflective of strong growth in
        the Company's three largest geographic\noperating segments, was the principal
        cause of the increase in net sales during\nthe first six months of 2000.\n\nNet
        sales declined sequentially during the second quarter of 2000 compared to\nthe
        first quarter of 2000 by $398 million or 17%. Similarly, Macintosh unit\nsales
        decreased 24% during the second quarter of 2000 compared to the first\nquarter.
        The sequential decline in both net sales and unit sales during the\nsecond
        quarter is consistent with the historical pattern experienced by the\nCompany
        due to lower demand in the Company's consumer markets following the\nholiday
        season. The sequential decrease in unit sales was somewhat offset by a\nsequential
        increase in the average revenue per Macintosh system, which rose from\n$1,673
        during the first quarter of 2000 to $1,820 during the second quarter. The\nincrease
        during the current quarter in the average revenue per Macintosh system\nis
        primarily attributable to the shift in the Company's unit mix towards\nhigher-priced
        professional oriented products such that Power Macintosh and\nPowerBook units
        comprised 44% of total Macintosh units sales during the second\nquarter of
        2000 versus 32% during the first quarter.\n\nSEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE\n\nThe
        Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's\nreportable
        geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, and Japan. The\nAmericas
        segment includes both North and South America. The European segment\nincludes
        European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan\nsegment
        includes only Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar\nhardware
        and software products and similar services. Further information\nregarding
        the Company's operating segments may be found in this Form 10-Q in the\nNotes
        to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8, \"Segment\nInformation
        and Geographic Data.\"\n\n\n                                       14\n\n<PAGE>\n\nAMERICAS\n\nNet
        sales in the Americas segment during the second quarter of 2000 increased\n$202
        million or 26% compared to the same period in 1999. Macintosh unit sales in\nthe
        Americas increased 29% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting strong growth\nin
        iMac unit sales and unit sales of the recently introduced iBook. During the\nsecond
        quarters of both 2000 and 1999, the Americas segment represented\napproximately
        51% of the Company's total net sales. The results experienced by\nthe Americas
        segment in the second quarter of 2000 versus the same quarter in\n1999 reflect
        the Company's overall results characterized by strong growth in\nunit sales
        and net sales of the Company's consumer and education oriented\nproducts and
        moderate growth in net sales of the Company's professional oriented\nproducts.\n\nEUROPE\n\nNet
        sales in the Europe segment increased $101 million or 27% during the second\nquarter
        of 2000 as compared to the same quarter in 1999, while the segment's\nMacintosh
        unit sales increased 35%. Like the Americas segment, Europe's results\nin
        the second quarter of 2000 as compared to 1999 are indicative of strong\ngrowth
        in Macintosh unit sales, particularly unit sales of iMac and iBook.\n\nJAPAN\n\nNet
        sales in Japan rose 33% or $87 million during the second quarter of 2000 as\ncompared
        to the same quarter in 1999 while Macintosh unit sales increased 12%.\nThe
        increase in net sales was primarily the result of increased unit sales of\nprofessional
        oriented products and iBook, partially offset by a moderate decline\nin unit
        sales of iMac.\n\nGROSS MARGIN\n\nGross margin for the second quarter of 2000
        was 28.2% compared to 26.3% for the\nsame quarter in 1999 and 25.9% for the
        first quarter of 2000. Gross margin\nduring the second quarter of 2000 was
        favorably impacted by three principal\nfactors. First, component costs were
        lower during the second quarter of 2000\ncompared to previous quarters. In
        particular, costs for DRAM fell close to\nlevels not experienced since the
        fourth quarter of 1999. Second, freight costs\ndeclined sequentially from
        the first quarter of 2000 because substantially\nhigher air freight costs
        were incurred during the first quarter of 2000 compared\nto the second quarter
        in order to get products introduced during the first\nquarter into the sales
        channel in time for the holiday selling season. Third,\nthe Company's overall
        product mix shifted towards higher-priced, higher margin\nprofessional products.
        Net sales of Power Macintosh and PowerBook products\naccounted for 48.2% of
        total net sales during the second quarter of 2000 and\n39.2% of net sales
        during the first quarter of 2000.\n\nThere can be no assurance targeted gross
        margin levels will be achieved or\ncurrent margins on existing individual
        products will be maintained. In general,\ngross margins and margins on individual
        products will remain under significant\ndownward pressure due to a variety
        of factors, including continued industry wide\nglobal pricing pressures, increased
        competition, compressed product life cycles,\npotential increases in the cost
        and availability of raw material and outside\nmanufacturing services, fluctuations
        in freight costs incurred to deliver the\nCompany's products to market, and
        potential changes to the Company's product\nmix, including higher unit sales
        of consumer products with lower average selling\nprices and lower gross margins.
        In response to these downward pressures, the\nCompany expects it will continue
        to take pricing actions with respect to its\nproducts. Gross margins could
        also be affected by the Company's ability to\neffectively manage quality problems
        and warranty costs and to stimulate demand\nfor certain of its products. The
        Company's operating strategy and pricing take\ninto account anticipated changes
        in foreign currency exchange rates over time;\nhowever, the Company's results
        of operations can be significantly affected in\nthe short term by fluctuations
        in exchange rates.\n\nOPERATING EXPENSES\n\nSelling, general and administrative
        expenses, excluding special charges,\nincreased $48 million or 20% during
        second quarter of 2000 as compared to the\nsame period in 1999 and decreased
        sequentially $32 million or 10% from the first\nquarter of 2000. The sequential
        decline from the first quarter of 2000 reflects\n\n                                       15\n<PAGE>\nthe
        typical seasonal decline in advertising and promotional activity associated\nwith
        the 1999 holiday season. Selling, general and administrative expenses for\nthe
        first six months of 2000 increased $88 million or 17% as compared to the\nsame
        period in 1999. However, as a result of growing net sales, selling, general\nand
        administrative expenses fell to 14% of net sales during the first six months\nof
        2000 compared to 16% during the same period in 1999. The absolute\nyear-over-year
        increases in selling, general and administrative expenses for\nboth the second
        quarter and the first six months of 2000 is the result of higher\nvariable
        selling and marketing expenses resulting from the year-over-year\nincrease
        in net sales and due to higher discretionary spending on marketing and\nadvertising
        in 2000 as compared to 1999.\n\nExpenditures for research and development
        increased 21% between the second\nquarter of fiscal 2000 and the same quarter
        in 1999 and increased 20% during the\nfirst six months of 2000 compared to
        the same period in 1999. These increases\nresulted primarily from increased
        spending in 2000 to support product\ndevelopment activities and increased
        research and development headcount.\n\nSPECIAL CHARGES\n\nDuring the first
        quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions\nresulting in
        recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was\ncomprised
        of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5\nmillion
        for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with\nconsolidation
        of various domestic and international sales and marketing\nfunctions. Of the
        $5 million accrued for severance, $1.7 million had been spent\nby April 1,
        2000, and the remainder is expected to be spent over the following\ntwo quarters.
        Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets,\nsubstantially
        all was utilized by April 1, 2000.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2000, the
        Company's Board of Directors approved a\nspecial executive bonus for the Company's
        Chief Executive Officer for past\nservices in the form of an aircraft with
        a total cost to the company of\napproximately $90 million, the majority of
        which is not tax deductible.\nApproximately half of the total charge is the
        cost of the aircraft. The other\nhalf represents all other costs and taxes
        associated with the purchase.\n\nTOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET\n\nInterest
        and other income and expense (net) increased $30 million or 158% to $49\nmillion
        during the second quarter of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999\nand
        increased $60 million or 207% for the first six months of 2000 over the same\nperiod
        in 1999. These increases are attributable to two factors. First, the\nCompany's
        cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were higher by\napproximately
        $687 million or 24% at the end of the second quarter of 2000\nversus the same
        balances at the end the second quarter of 1999. This resulted in\na $16 million
        or 48% increase in interest income between the second quarter of\n2000 and
        the second quarter of 1999 and an increase of $31 million or 48% for\nthe
        comparable six month periods. Second, as the result of conversion to common\nstock
        of the Company's convertible subordinated debentures during the third\nquarter
        of 1999, interest expense declined $10 million or 67% during the second\nquarter
        of 2000 compared to the same quarter in 1999 and decreased $21 million\nor
        68% for the comparable six month periods.\n\nDuring the second quarter of
        2000, the Company sold approximately 1.5 million\nshares of ARM stock for
        net proceeds of approximately $101 million and a gain\nbefore taxes of $100
        million. For the six-month period ended on April 1, 2000,\nthe Company sold
        approximately 6.7 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds\nof $237 million
        and a gain before taxes of $234 million. During the second\nquarter of 1999,
        the Company sold approximately 8.0 million shares of ARM stock\nfor net proceeds
        of approximately $59 million and a gain before taxes of $55\nmillion. For
        the six-month period ended on March 27, 1999, the Company sold\napproximately
        19.6 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $96 million\nand a gain
        before taxes of $87 million.\n\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nAs of April
        1, 2000, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible\ntemporary
        differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $580 million before being\noffset
        against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the\nCompany's
        balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based\non
        the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of April 1, 2000,\na
        valuation allowance of $45 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset\nfor
        the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance\n\n
        \                                      16\n<PAGE>\nprimarily relates to the
        operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to\ntax benefits in certain
        foreign jurisdictions. The Company will continue to\nevaluate the realizability
        of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the\nneed for and amount
        of the valuation allowance.\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the first
        quarter of 2000, was\napproximately 33% and includes the effect of the special
        executive bonus accrued\nduring that quarter. The effective tax rate during
        the first quarter of 2000\nwithout this charge was approximately 25%. The
        Company's effective tax rate for\nthe three months ended April 1, 2000, was
        approximately 27% which brings the\neffective tax rate without the special
        executive bonus for the six months ended\nApril 1, 2000, to 26%. This effective
        rate is less than the statutory federal\nincome tax rate of 35% due primarily
        to the reversal of a portion of the\npreviously established valuation allowance
        for tax loss and credit carryforwards\nand certain undistributed foreign earnings
        for which no U.S. taxes were\nprovided.\n\nTHE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES
        THAT ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF\n2000 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY
        26%. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS EFFECTIVE TAX\nRATE WILL INCREASE IN
        2001. THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THE\nCOMPANY'S ACTUAL
        RESULTS COULD DIFFER BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING\nTHOSE SET FORTH
        BELOW IN THE SUBSECTION ENTITLED \"FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE\nRESULTS
        AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\" ADDITIONALLY, THE ACTUAL FUTURE TAX RATE WILL\nBE
        SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE AMOUNT OF AND JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE\nCOMPANY'S
        FOREIGN PROFITS ARE EARNED.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nThe following

        and most recent quarterly cost of\n         sales adjusted for the change
        in inventory.\n\nAs of April 1, 2000, the Company had approximately $3.6 billion
        in cash, cash\nequivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $383
        million over the\nsame balances at the end of 1999. For the six months ended
        April 1, 2000, the\nCompany's primary source of cash was $434 million in cash
        flows from operating\nactivities. Cash generated by operations was primarily
        from net income of $416\nmillion and a combined increase in accounts payable
        and other current\nliabilities of $368 million partially offset by an increase
        in accounts\nreceivable of $259 million. In addition to operating cash flow,
        other\nsignificant cash flow items during the six months ended April 1, 2000
        included\nnet purchases of short-term investments of $47 million, $216 million
        utilized\nfor the purchase of long-term investments, $65 million for the purchase
        of\nproperty, plant and equipment, and cash proceeds from the sale of ARM
        stock of\n$237 million.\n\nIn July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors
        authorized a plan for the Company\nto repurchase up to $500 million of its
        common stock. This repurchase plan does\nnot obligate the Company to acquire
        any specific number of shares or acquire\nshares over any specified period
        of time. During the second quarter of 2000, no\nshares of common stock were
        repurchased. Since inception of the repurchase plan,\nthe Company has repurchased
        1.75 million shares at a cost of $116 million.\n\nOn November 18, 1999, the
        Company entered into a $100 million revolving credit\nagreement with Bank

        portion of the credit facility. No advances have been made against this\ncredit
        facility. This revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the\nCompany
        with an additional source of short-term liquidity.\n\nThe Company believes
        its balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments, and available
        credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its\ncash requirements over the
        next twelve months, including any cash that may be\nutilized by its stock
        repurchase plan. However, given the Company's current\nnon-investment grade
        debt ratings, if the Company should need to obtain\nshort-term borrowings,
        there can no assurance such borrowings could be\nobtained at favorable rates.
        The inability to obtain such borrowings at\nfavorable rates could materially
        adversely affect the Company's results of\noperations, financial condition,
        and liquidity.\n\nOTHER INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Company holds significant investments
        in ARM, Samsung, Akamai and\nEarthlink. These investments are reflected in
        the consolidated balances sheets\nas non-current debt and equity investments
        and have been categorized as\navailable-for-sale requiring that they be carried
        at fair value with\nunrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in
        equity as a component\nof accumulated other comprehensive income. The combined
        fair value of these\ninvestments was $1.544 billion and $339 million as of
        April 1, 2000, and\nSeptember 25, 1999, respectively. The combined fair value
        of these investments\nhas declined to approximately $1.215 billion as of May
        5, 2000. The Company\nbelieves it is likely there will continue to be significant
        fluctuations in\nthe fair value of these investments in the future. Additional
        information\nregarding these investment may be found in this Form 10-Q in
        the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 4, \"Non-Current
        Debt and\nEquity Investments.\"\n\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
        AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nThe Company operates in a rapidly changing environment
        that involves a number\nof uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's
        control. In addition\nto the uncertainties described elsewhere in this report,
        there are many\nfactors that will affect the Company's future results and
        business, which may\ncause the actual results to differ from those currently
        expected. The\nCompany's future operating results and financial condition
        is dependent upon\nthe Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture,
        and market\ntechnologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer
        demand\npatterns. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the
        Company\nmust successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating\nresults
        and a favorable financial condition.\n\nPotential risks and uncertainties
        that could affect the Company's future\noperating results and financial condition
        include, among other things,\ncontinued competitive pressures in the marketplace
        and the effect of any\nreaction by the Company to such competitive pressures,
        including pricing\nactions by the Company; risks associated with international
        operations,\nincluding economic and labor conditions, regional economic problems,
        political\ninstability, tax laws, and currency fluctuations; increasing dependence
        on\nthird-parties for manufacturing and other outsourced functions such as\nlogistics;
        the availability of key components on terms acceptable to the\nCompany; the
        continued availability of certain components and services\nessential to the
        Company's business currently obtained by the Company from\nsole or limited
        sources, including PowerPC RISC microprocessors developed by\nand obtained
        from IBM and Motorola and the final assembly of certain of the\nCompany's
        products; the Company's ability to supply products in certain\ncategories;
        the Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or\nother
        faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace\nof
        technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely\ndelivery
        of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and timely delivery of\nfuture
        versions of the Mac OS; the availability of third-party software for\nparticular
        applications; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain\nkey employees;
        the effect of previously undetected Y2K compliance issues;\nmanaging the continuing
        impact of the European Union's transition to the Euro\nas its common legal
        currency; continuing fluctuations in the fair value of the\nCompany's non-current
        debt and equity investments, and the Company's ability\nto retain the operational
        and cost benefits derived from its recently\ncompleted restructuring programs.\n\nFor
        a discussion of these and other factors affecting the Company's future\nresults
        and financial condition, see \"Item 7 -- Management's Discussion and\nAnalysis
        -- Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\" in\nthe
        Company's 1999 Form 10-K.\n\n                                       18\n<PAGE>\n\nITEM
        3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nTHE INFORMATION
        PRESENTED BELOW REGARDING MARKET RISK CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING\nSTATEMENTS
        THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL\nRESULTS
        MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN\nTHIS
        FORM 10-Q REGARDING MARKET RISK. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN\nCONJUNCTION
        WITH THE 1999 FORM 10-K AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS
        AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q.\n\nThe Company's exposure
        to market risk for changes in interest rates relates\nprimarily to the Company's
        investments and long-term debt obligations and\nrelated derivative financial
        instruments. The Company places its investments\nwith high credit quality
        issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit\nexposure to any one issuer.
        The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of\nprincipal loss and ensure
        the safety of invested funds by limiting market and\ncredit risk. Excluding
        those investments classified as non-current debt and\nequity investments,
        all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three\nmonths or less at
        the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents;\ninvestments with
        maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be\nshort-term
        investments. As of April 1, 2000, substantially all of the Company's\ninvestments
        have maturities less than 12 months.\n\nDuring the last two years, the Company
        has entered into interest rate derivative\ntransactions, including interest
        rate swaps and floors, with financial\ninstitutions in order to better match
        the Company's floating-rate interest\nincome on its cash equivalents and short-term
        investments with its fixed-rate\ninterest expense on its long-term debt, and/or
        to diversify a portion of the\nCompany's exposure away from fluctuations in
        short-term U.S. interest rates. The\nCompany may also enter into interest
        rate contracts that are intended to reduce\nthe cost of the interest rate
        risk management program. The Company does not hold\nor transact in such financial
        instruments for purposes other than risk\nmanagement.\n\nOverall, the Company
        is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar\nand, as such,
        benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a\nstronger dollar
        relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in\nexchange
        rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may\nnegatively
        affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.\ndollars.\n\nThe
        Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with\nfinancial
        institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks\nassociated
        with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed\ntransactions,
        and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company's\nforeign
        exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its\nexisting
        material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company\nmay
        not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial\neither
        in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of the related\ncurrency's
        historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange\nforward
        contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities. The\npremium
        costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in\nother
        current assets and marked to market through earnings.\n\nTo ensure the adequacy
        and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and\ninterest rate hedge
        positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities\nof the nonhedge
        portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign\nexchange forward
        and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and\nfloor positions
        both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its\nunderlying foreign
        currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively,\nfrom both an
        accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the\neffective horizons
        of the Company's risk management activities and the\nanticipatory nature of
        the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no\nassurance the aforementioned
        programs will offset more than a portion of the\nadverse financial impact
        resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign\nexchange or interest
        rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for\nrecognition of gains
        and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any\ngiven period may
        not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the\nunderlying
        economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's\noperating
        results and financial position.\n\n\n                                       19\n\n<PAGE>\n\nFor
        a complete description of the Company's interest rate and foreign\ncurrency
        related market risks, see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of the\nCompany's
        1999 Form 10-K. There has not been a material change in the\nCompany's exposure
        to interest rate and foreign currency risks since the date\nof the 1999 Form
        10-K.\n\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nThe Company
        is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which are\ndiscussed in
        the 1999 Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to certain other\nlegal proceedings
        and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and which
        have not been fully adjudicated. The results of legal\nproceedings cannot
        be predicted with certainty; however, in the opinion of\nmanagement, the Company
        does not have a potential liability related to any legal\nproceedings and
        claims that would have a material adverse effect on its\nfinancial condition
        or results of operations.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY

        Company.  In no event may an Option or SAR be granted\nto any individual who,
        at the time of grant, is an Officer or Director.  An\nEmployee who has been
        granted an Option or SAR may, if he or she is otherwise\neligible, be granted
        an additional Option or Options, SAR or SARs.  Each Option\nshall be evidenced
        by a written Option agreement, which shall be in such form\nand contain such
        provisions as the Administrator shall from time to time deem\nappropriate.
        \ Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrator may, at any\ntime, or

        Company), nor shall it interfere in any way\nwith the Optionee's right or
        the right of the Company (or any Parent, Subsidiary\nor Affiliated Company)
        to terminate the Optionee's employment at any time or for\nany reason.\n\n
        \      If an Option or SAR is granted to an individual who is a consultant
        to\nthe Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, all references in the Plan
        to\n\"Employee\" shall be deemed to include the term \"consultant\" and all
        references\nin the Plan to \"employment,\" \"Continuous Status as an Employee\"
        and\n\"termination of employment\" shall be deemed to refer to the individual's\nconsultancy
        or status as a consultant.\n\n       6.     TERM OF PLAN.  The Plan shall
        become effective upon its adoption\nby the Board.  It shall continue in effect
        for a term of ten years unless sooner\nterminated under Section 14 of the
        Plan.\n\n       7.     TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be ten

        \             (a)    EXERCISE PRICE.  The per Share exercise price for the\nShares
        issuable pursuant to an Option shall be such price as is determined by\nthe
        Administrator, but shall in no event be less than 100% of the Fair Market\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\nValue
        of Common Stock, determined as of the date of grant of the Option.  In\nthe
        event that the Administrator shall reduce the exercise price, the exercise\nprice
        shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value as of the date of\nthat
        reduction.\n\n              (b)    METHOD OF PAYMENT.  The consideration to
        be paid for the\nShares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including
        the method of payment,\nshall be determined by the Administrator and may consist
        of (i) cash, (ii)\ncheck, (iii) promissory note, (iv) other Shares which have

        price of the Shares as\nto which said Option shall be exercised, (v) delivery
        of a properly executed\nexercise notice together with irrevocable instructions
        to a broker to promptly\ndeliver to the Company the amount of sale or loan

        foregoing methods of payment\nand/or any other consideration or method of
        payment as shall be permitted under\napplicable corporate law.\n\n       9.
        \    STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.\n\n              (a)    GRANTED IN CONNECTION
        WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion\nof the Administrator, SARs may be granted
        in connection with all or any part of\nan Option, either concurrently with
        the grant of the Option or at any time\nthereafter during the term of the
        Option.  The following provisions apply to\nSARs that are granted in connection
        with Options:\n\n       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise
        the SAR by\n       surrendering to the Company unexercised a portion of the
        related Option.\n       The Optionee shall receive in exchange from the Company
        an amount equal\n       to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the
        date of exercise of the\n       SAR of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered
        portion of the related\n       Option over (y) the exercise price of the Common
        Stock covered by the\n       surrendered portion of the related Option.  Notwithstanding
        the\n       foregoing, the Administrator may place limits on the amount that
        may be\n       paid upon exercise of an SAR; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
        limit shall\n       not restrict the exercisability of the related Option.\n\n
        \      (ii)   When an SAR is exercised, the related Option, to the extent\n
        \      surrendered, shall no longer be exercisable.\n\n       (iii)  An SAR
        shall be exercisable only when and to the extent that the\n       related
        Option is exercisable and shall expire no later than the date on\n       which
        the related Option expires.\n\n       (iv)   An SAR may only be exercised
        at a time when the Fair Market Value\n       of the Common Stock covered by
        the related Option exceeds the exercise\n       price of the Common Stock
        covered by the related Option.\n\n              (b)    INDEPENDENT SARS.  At
        the sole discretion of the\nAdministrator, SARs may be granted without related
        Options.  The following\nprovisions apply to SARs that are not granted in
        connection with Options:\n\n       (i)    The SAR shall entitle the Optionee,
        by exercising the SAR, to\n       receive from the Company an amount equal
        to the excess of (x) the Fair\n       Market Value of the Common Stock covered
        by exercised portion of the SAR,\n       as of the date of such exercise,
        over (y) the Fair Market Value of the\n       Common Stock covered by the
        exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date\n       on which the SAR was
        granted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrator\n       may place limits
        on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of an SAR.\n\n       (ii)   SARs
        shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as\n       the Administrator
        shall specify in the Optionee's SAR agreement.\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n              (c)
        \   FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the\nexercise
        of an SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any combination\nof
        Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may\ndetermine.
        \ Shares issued upon the exercise of an SAR shall be valued at their\nFair
        Market Value as of the date of exercise.\n\n       10.    METHOD OF EXERCISE.\n\n
        \             (a)    PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any\nOption
        or SAR granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under\nsuch
        conditions as determined by the Administrator and as shall be permissible\nunder
        the terms of the Plan.\n\n              An Option or SAR shall be deemed to
        be exercised when written\nnotice of such exercise has been given to the Company
        in accordance with the\nterms of the Option or SAR by the person entitled
        to exercise the Option or SAR\nand full payment for the Shares with respect
        to which the Option is exercised\nhas been received by the Company.  Full
        payment may, as authorized by the\nAdministrator and permitted by the Option
        agreement, consist of any\nconsideration and method of payment allowable under
        Section 8(b) of the Plan.\nUntil the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate
        entry on the books of the\nCompany or of a duly authorized transfer agent
        of the Company) of the stock\ncertificate evidencing such Shares, no right
        to vote or receive dividends or any\nother rights as a shareholder shall exist
        with respect to the Optioned Stock,\nnotwithstanding the exercise of the Option.
        \ No adjustment will be made for a\ndividend or other right for which the
        record date is prior to the date the stock\ncertificate is issued, except
        as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.  An Option\nor SAR may not be exercised
        with respect to a fraction of a Share.\n\n              (b)    TERMINATION
        OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of\nan Optionee's Continuous Status
        as Employee (other than termination by reason of\nthe Optionee's death), the
        Optionee may, but only within ninety days after the\ndate of such termination,
        exercise his or her Option or SAR to the extent that\nit was exercisable at
        the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, however, an
        Option or SAR may not be exercised after the date the\nOption or SAR would
        otherwise expire by its terms due to the passage of time\nfrom the date of
        grant.\n\n              (c)    DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  In the event of the death
        of an\nOptionee:\n\n       (i)    Who is at the time of death an Employee
        and who shall have been in\n       Continuous Status as an Employee since
        the date of grant of the Option,\n       the Option or SAR may be exercised
        at any time within six (6) months (or\n       such other period of time not
        exceeding twelve (12) months as determined\n       by the Administrator) following
        the date of death by the Optionee's\n       estate or by a person who acquired
        the right to exercise the Option by\n       bequest or inheritance, but only
        to the extent of the right to exercise\n       that would have accrued had
        the Optionee continued living and terminated\n       his or her employment
        six (6) months (or such other period of time not\n       exceeding twelve
        (12) months as determined by the Administrator) after\n       the date of
        death; or\n\n       (ii)   Within ninety days after the termination of Continuous
        Status as\n       an Employee, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any
        time within six\n       (6) months (or such other period of time not exceeding
        twelve (12) months\n       as determined by the Administrator) following the
        date of death by the\n       Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired
        the right to exercise the\n       Option by bequest or inheritance, but only
        to the extent of the right to\n       exercise that had accrued at the date
        of termination.\n\n              Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, an
        Option or SAR may not\nbe exercised after the date the Option or SAR would
        otherwise expire by its\nterms due to the passage of time from the date of
        grant.\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n              (d)    STOCK WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING
        TAX OBLIGATIONS.\nWhen an Optionee incurs tax liability in connection with
        the exercise of an\nOption or SAR, which tax liability is subject to tax withholding
        under\napplicable tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay the Company
        an amount\nrequired to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the Optionee
        may satisfy the\nwithholding tax obligation (including, at the election of
        the Optionee, any\nadditional amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld
        in order to\nsatisfy in whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax
        in connection with\nthe exercise) by electing to have the Company withhold
        from the Shares to be\nissued upon exercise of the Option, or the Shares to
        be issued upon exercise of\nthe SAR, if any, that number of Shares having
        a Fair Market Value equal to the\namount required to be withheld (and any
        additional amount desired to be\nwithheld, as aforesaid).  The Fair Market
        Value of the Shares to be withheld\nshall be determined on the date that the
        amount of tax to be withheld is to be\ndetermined (the \"TAX DATE\").\n\n
        \             All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this\npurpose
        shall be made in writing in a form acceptable to the Administrator and\nshall
        be subject to the following restrictions:\n\n              (i)    the election
        must be made on or prior to the applicable Tax\nDate; and\n\n              (ii)
        \  all elections shall be subject to the consent or\ndisapproval of the Administrator.\n\n
        \      11.    NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS.  Options and SARs may not be
        sold,\npledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any
        manner other\nthan by will or by the laws of descent or distribution or pursuant
        to a\nqualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or Title I
        of the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder;
        PROVIDED,\nHOWEVER, that the Administrator may grant Nonstatutory Stock Options
        that are\nfreely transferable.  The designation of a beneficiary by an Optionee
        or holder\nof an SAR does not constitute a transfer.  An Option or an SAR
        may be exercised,\nduring the lifetime of the Optionee or SAR holder, only
        by the Optionee or SAR\nholder or by a transferee permitted by this Section
        11.\n\n       12.    ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION OR MERGER.\n\n
        \             (a)    CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action\nby
        the shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each\noutstanding
        Option and SAR, and the number of Shares which have been authorized\nfor issuance
        under the Plan but as to which no Options or SARs have yet been\ngranted or
        which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration\nof an
        Option or SAR, as well as the price per Share covered by each such\noutstanding
        Option or SAR, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or\ndecrease
        in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse\nstock
        split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common\nStock,
        or any other increase or decrease in the aggregate number of issued\nShares
        effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; PROVIDED,\nHOWEVER,
        that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not\nbe
        deemed to have been \"effected without receipt of consideration.\"  Such\nadjustment
        shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination in that\nrespect shall
        be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as expressly provided\nherein, no
        issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or\nsecurities convertible
        into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no\nadjustment by reason
        thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price\nof Shares subject
        to an Option or SAR.\n\n              (b)    DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In
        the event of the proposed\ndissolution or liquidation of the Company, all
        outstanding Options and SARs will\nterminate immediately prior to the consummation
        of such proposed action, unless\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\notherwise provided by the Administrator.
        \ The Administrator may, in the\nexercise of its sole discretion in such instances,
        declare that any Option or\nSAR shall terminate as of a date fixed by the
        Administrator and give each\nOptionee the right to exercise his or her Option
        or SAR as to all or any part\nof the Optioned Stock or SAR, including Shares
        as to which the Option or SAR\nwould not otherwise be exercisable.\n\n              (c)
        \   SALE OF ASSETS OR MERGER. Subject to the provisions of\nSection 12(d),
        in the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of\nthe assets
        of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another\ncorporation,
        each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent\noption
        or stock appreciation right shall be substituted by such successor\ncorporation
        or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the\nAdministrator
        determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of\nsuch assumption
        or substitution, that the Optionee shall have the right to\nexercise the Option
        or SAR as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as\nto which the
        Option or SAR would not otherwise be exercisable.  If the\nAdministrator makes
        an Option or SAR fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or\nsubstitution
        in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Company shall\nnotify the
        Optionee that the Option or SAR shall be fully exercisable for a\nperiod of
        thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR\nwill
        terminate upon the expiration of such period.  For purposes of this\nparagraph,
        an Option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed if,\nfollowing
        the sale of assets or merger, the Option confers the right to\npurchase, for
        each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option immediately\nprior to the
        sale of assets or merger, the consideration (whether stock, cash or\nother
        securities or property) received in the sale of assets or merger by\nholders
        of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the\ntransaction
        (and if such holders were offered a choice of consideration, the\ntype of
        consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding\nShares);
        provided, however, that if such consideration received in the sale of\nassets
        or merger was not solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or its\nparent,
        the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation and\nthe
        participant, provide for the per share consideration to be received upon\nexercise
        of te Option to be solely Common Stock of the successor corporation or\nits
        parent equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received
        by\nholders of Common Stock in the sale of assets or merger.\n\n              (d)
        \   CHANGE IN CONTROL.  In the event of a \"Change in Control\"\nof the Company,
        as defined in Section 12(e), unless otherwise determined by the\nAdministrator
        prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the following\nacceleration
        and valuation provisions shall apply:\n\n       (i)    Any Options and SARs
        outstanding as of the date such Change in\n       Control is determined to
        have occurred that are not yet exercisable and\n       vested on such date
        shall become fully exercisable and vested; and\n\n       (ii)   The value
        of all outstanding Options and SARs shall, unless\n       otherwise determined
        by the Administrator at or after grant, be\n       cashed-out.  The amount
        at which such Options and SARs shall be cashed\n       out shall be equal
        to the excess of (x) the Change in Control Price (as\n       defined below)
        over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by\n       the Option
        or SAR.  The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to the Optionee\n       or, in
        the event of death of an Optionee prior to payment, to the estate\n       of
        the Optionee or to a person who acquired the right to exercise the\n       Option
        or SAR by bequest or inheritance.\n\n              (e)    \"DEFINITION OF
        \"CHANGE IN CONTROL\".  For purposes of this\nSection 12, a \"Change in Control\"
        means the happening of any of the following:\n\n       ( i )  When any \"person\",
        as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and\n       14(d) of the Exchange Act

        plan, including any trustee of such plan acting\n       as trustee) is or
        becomes the \"beneficial owner\" (as defined in\n       Rule 13d-3 under the
        Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities\n       of the Company
        representing\n\n\n<PAGE>\n\n       fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined
        voting power of the Company's\n       then outstanding securities; or\n\n
        \      (ii)   The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval,\n
        \      and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
        the\n       Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation.\n\n
        \             (f)    CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For purposes of this Section
        12,\n\"Change in Control Price\" shall be, as determined by the Administrator,
        (i) the\nhighest Fair Market Value at any time within the sixty-day period

        price paid or\noffered, as determined by the Administrator, in any bona fide
        transaction or\nbona fide offer related to the Change in Control of the Company,

        Option or SAR.  Notice of the determination shall be\ngiven to each Employee
        to whom an Option or SAR is so granted within a\nreasonable time after the
        date of such grant.\n\n       14.    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.\n\n
        \             (a)    AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time\namend,
        alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as it may deem advisable.\n\n              (b)

        suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair the rights of\nany
        Optionee or SAR holder under any grant theretofore made without his or her\nconsent.
        \ Such Options and SARs shall remain in full force and effect as if this\nPlan
        had not been amended or terminated.\n\n       15.    CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE
        OF SHARES.  Shares shall not be issued\nwith respect to an Option or SAR unless
        the exercise of such Option or SAR and\nthe issuance and delivery of such
        Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all\nrelevant provisions of law,
        including, without limitation, the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, the

        MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES. If permitted by Rule 16b-3\n       promulgated
        under the Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto, as in\n       effect
        at the time that discretion is being exercised with respect to the\n       Plan,
        and by the legal requirements of the Applicable Laws relating to\n       the
        administration of stock plans such as the Plan, if any, the Plan may\n       (but
        need not) be administered by different administrative bodies with\n       respect
        to (A) Directors who are not Employees, (B) Directors who are\n       Employees,
        (C) Officers who are not Directors and (D) Employees who are\n       neither
        Directors nor Officers.\n\n           (ii) SECTION 162(m). To the extent that
        the Administrator determines\n       it to be desirable to qualify Options
        or SARs granted hereunder as\n       \"performance-based compensation\" within
        the meaning of Section 162(m) of\n       the Code, the Plan shall be administered
        by a Committee of two or more\n       \"outside directors\" within the meaning
        of Section 162(m) of the Code.\n\n<PAGE>\n          (iii) RULE 16b-3. To the
        extent desirable to qualify transactions\n       hereunder as exempt under
        Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated\n       hereunder shall be structured
        to satisfy the requirements for exemption\n       under Rule 16b-3.\n\n           (iv)
        OTHER ADMINISTRATION. Other than as provided above, the Plan\n       shall
        be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a Committee, which\n       committee
        shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws.\n\n        (b)  POWERS OF
        THE ADMINISTRATOR.  Subject to the provisions of the\n    Plan, and in the
        case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties\n    delegated by the
        Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the\n    authority,
        in its discretion:\n\n           (i) to determine the Fair Market Value;\n\n
        \          (ii) to select the person(s) to whom Options, SARs and Stock Purchase\n
        \      Rights may be granted hereunder;\n\n          (iii) to determine the
        number of shares of Common Stock to be covered\n       by each Option, SAR
        or Stock Purchase Right granted hereunder;\n\n           (iv) to approve forms
        of agreement for use under the Plan;\n\n           (v) to determine the terms
        and conditions, not inconsistent with the\n       terms of the Plan, of any
        Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right granted\n       hereunder. Such terms
        and conditions include, but are not limited to, the\n       exercise price,
        the date of grant, the time or times when Options, SARs\n       or Stock Purchase
        Rights may be exercised (which may be based on\n       performance criteria),
        any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture\n       restrictions, and
        any restriction or limitation regarding any Option, SAR\n       or Stock Purchase
        Right or the shares of Common Stock relating thereto,\n       based in each
        case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole\n       discretion,
        shall determine;\n\n           (vi) to reduce the exercise price of any Option,
        SAR or Stock\n       Purchase Right to the then current Fair Market Value
        if the Fair Market\n       Value of the Common Stock covered by such Option,
        SAR or Stock Purchase\n       Right shall have declined since the date the
        Option, SAR or Stock\n       Purchase Right was granted;\n\n          (vii)
        to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards\n       granted
        pursuant to the Plan;\n\n         (viii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules
        and regulations relating\n       to the Plan, including rules and regulations
        relating to sub-plans\n       established for the purpose of qualifying for
        preferred tax treatment\n       under foreign tax laws;\n\n           (ix)
        to modify or amend each Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right\n       (subject
        to Section 17(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary\n       authority
        to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options\n       longer
        than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;\n\n           (x) to allow Optionees
        to satisfy withholding tax obligations by\n       electing to have the Company
        withhold from the Shares to be issued upon\n       exercise of an Option,
        SAR or Stock Purchase Right that number of Shares\n       having a Fair Market
        Value equal to the amount required to be withheld.\n       The Fair Market
        Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on\n       the date
        that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All\n       elections
        by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall\n       be made
        in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may\n       deem
        necessary or advisable;\n\n           (xi) to authorize any person to execute
        on behalf of the Company any\n       instrument required to effect the grant
        of an Option, SAR or Stock\n       Purchase Right previously granted by the
        Administrator; and\n\n<PAGE>\n          (xii) to make all other determinations
        deemed necessary or advisable\n       for administering the Plan.\n\n        (c)
        \ EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATOR'S DECISION.  The Administrator's decisions,\n    determinations
        and interpretations shall be final and binding on all\n    Optionees and any
        other holders of Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights.\n\n    5.  ELIGIBILITY.
        \ Nonstatutory Stock Options, SARs and Stock Purchase Rights\nmay be granted
        to the Chairman, Executive Officers and other key employees or to\nsuch other
        individuals as determined by the Administrator whom the Company has\noffered
        a position of Chairman or Executive Officer. Incentive Stock Options may\nbe
        granted only to Executive Officers and other key employees.\n\n    6.  LIMITATIONS.\n\n
        \       (a) Each Option shall be designated in the Agreement as either an\n
        \   Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,\n    notwithstanding
        such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair\n    Market Value
        of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are\n    exercisable
        for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year\n    (under all
        plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds\n    $100,000,
        such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For\n    purposes
        of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into\n    account
        in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of\n    the
        Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to\n    such
        Shares is granted.\n\n        (b) Neither the Plan nor any Option, SAR or
        Stock Purchase Right shall\n    confer upon an Optionee any right with respect
        to continuing the Optionee's\n    relationship as an Employee with or Chairman
        of the Company, nor shall they\n    interfere in any way with the Optionee's
        right or the Company's right to\n    terminate such relationship at any time,
        with or without cause.\n\n        (c) The following limitations shall apply
        to grants of Options and SARs:\n\n           (i) No participant shall be granted,
        in any fiscal year of the\n       Company, Options or SARs to purchase more
        than 17,000,000 Shares;\n\n           (ii) The foregoing limitations shall
        be adjusted proportionately in\n       connection with any change in the Company's
        capitalization as described\n       in Section 15;\n\n          (iii) If an
        Option or SAR is canceled in the same fiscal year of the\n       Company in
        which it was granted (other than in connection with a\n       transaction
        described in Section 15), the canceled Option will be counted\n       against
        the limits set forth in subsections (i) above. For this purpose,\n       if
        the exercise price of an Option or SAR is reduced, the transaction\n       will
        be treated as a cancellation of the Option or SAR and the grant of a\n       new
        Option or SAR.\n\n    7.  TERM OF PLAN.  Subject to Section 21 of the Plan,
        the Plan shall become\neffective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall
        continue in effect for a term\nof ten (10) years unless terminated earlier
        under Section 16 of the Plan.\n\n    8.  TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each
        Option shall be stated in the\nAgreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock
        Option, the term shall be ten (10)\nyears from the date of grant or such shorter
        term as may be provided in the\nAgreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive
        Stock Option granted to an\nOptionee who, at the time the Incentive Stock
        Option is granted, owns stock\nrepresenting more than ten percent (10%) of
        the total combined voting power of\nall classes of stock of the Company or
        any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the\nIncentive Stock Option shall be
        five (5) years from the date of grant or such\nshorter term as may be provided
        in the Agreement.\n\n<PAGE>\n    9.  OPTION EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.\n\n
        \       (a)  EXERCISE PRICE.  The per share exercise price for the Shares
        to be\n    issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by
        the\n    Administrator, subject to the following:\n\n           (i) In the
        case of an Incentive Stock Option;\n\n              (A) granted to an Employee
        who, at the time the Incentive Stock\n           Option is granted, owns stock
        representing more than ten percent\n           (10%) of the voting power of
        all classes of stock of the Company or\n           any Parent or Subsidiary,
        the per Share exercise price shall be no\n           less than 110% of the
        Fair Market Value per Share on the date of\n           grant; or\n\n               (B)
        granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in\n           paragraph
        (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall\n           be no
        less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date\n           of
        grant;\n\n           (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the
        per Share\n       exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator.
        In the case of a\n       Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as
        'performance-based\n       compensation' within the meaning of Section 162(m)
        of the Code, the per\n       Share exercise price shall be no less than 100%
        of the Fair Market Value\n       per Share on the date of grant;\n\n          (iii)
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per\n       Share
        exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share\n       on
        the date of grant as determined by the Administrator or pursuant to a\n       merger
        or other corporate transaction.\n\n        (b)  WAITING PERIOD AND EXERCISE
        DATES.  At the time an Option is\n    granted, the Administrator shall fix
        the period within which the Option may\n    be exercised and shall determine
        any conditions which must be satisfied\n    before the Option may be exercised.\n\n
        \       (c)  FORM OF CONSIDERATION.  The Administrator shall determine the\n
        \   acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the\n
        \   method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the\n    Administrator
        shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the\n    time of grant.
        Such consideration may consist entirely of:\n\n           (i) cash;\n\n           (ii)
        check;\n\n          (iii) promissory note;\n\n           (iv) other Shares
        which (A) in the case of Shares acquired upon\n       exercise of an option,
        have been owned by the Optionee for more than six\n       months on the date
        of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the\n       date of surrender
        equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as\n       to which said
        Option shall be exercised;\n\n           (v) consideration received by the
        Company under a cashless exercise\n       program implemented by the Company
        in connection with the Plan;\n\n           (vi) a reduction in the amount
        of any Company liability to the\n       Optionee, including any liability
        attributable to the Optionee's\n       participation in any Company-sponsored
        deferred compensation program or\n       arrangement;\n\n          (vii) any
        combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or\n\n         (viii) such
        other consideration and method of payment for the issuance\n       of Shares
        to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.\n\n<PAGE>\n    10.  STOCK APPRECIATION
        RIGHTS.\n\n        (a)  GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH OPTIONS.  At the sole discretion
        of the\n    Administrator, SARs may be granted in connection with all or any
        part of an\n    Option, either concurrently with the grant of the Option or
        at any time\n    thereafter during the term of the Option. The following provisions
        apply to\n    SARs that are granted in connection with Options:\n\n           (i)
        The SAR shall entitle the Optionee to exercise the SAR by\n       surrendering
        to the Company unexercised a portion of the related Option.\n       The Optionee
        shall receive in exchange from the Company an amount equal\n       to the
        excess of (x) the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the\n       SAR
        of the Common Stock covered by the surrendered portion of the related\n       Option
        over (y) the exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the\n       surrendered
        portion of the related Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\n       the
        Administrator may place limits on the amount that may be paid upon\n       exercise
        of a SAR; provided, however, that such limit shall not restrict\n       the
        exercisability of the related Option;\n\n           (ii) When a SAR is exercised,
        the related Option, to the extent\n       surrendered, shall no longer be
        exercisable;\n\n          (iii) A SAR shall be exercisable only when and to
        the extent that the\n       related Option is exercisable and shall expire
        no later than the date on\n       which the related Option expires; and\n\n
        \          (iv) A SAR may only be exercised at a time when the Fair Market
        Value\n       of the Common Stock covered by the related Option exceeds the
        exercise\n       price of the Common Stock covered by the related Option.\n\n
        \       (b)  INDEPENDENT SARS.  At the sole discretion of the Administrator,\n
        \   SARs may be granted without related Options. The following provisions
        apply\n    to SARs that are not granted in connection with Options:\n\n           (i)
        The SAR shall entitle the Optionee, by exercising the SAR, to\n       receive
        from the Company an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair\n       Market
        Value of the Common Stock covered by exercised portion of the SAR,\n       as
        of the date of such exercise, over (y) the Fair Market Value of the\n       Common
        Stock covered by the exercised portion of the SAR, as of the date\n       on
        which the SAR was granted; provided, however, that the Administrator\n       may
        place limits on the amount that may be paid upon exercise of a SAR;\n       and\n\n
        \          (ii) SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times
        as\n       the Administrator shall specify in the Optionee's Agreement.\n\n
        \       (c)  FORM OF PAYMENT.  The Company's obligation arising upon the\n
        \   exercise of a SAR may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or in any\n
        \   combination of Common Stock and cash, as the Administrator, in its sole\n
        \   discretion, may determine. Shares issued upon the exercise of a SAR shall
        be\n    valued at their Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise.\n\n
        \       (d)  RULE 16b-3.  SARs granted hereunder shall contain such additional\n
        \   restrictions as may be required to be contained in the Plan or Agreement
        in\n    order for the SAR to qualify for the maximum exemption provided by
        Rule\n    16b-3.\n\n    11.  EXERCISE OF OPTION OR SAR.\n\n        (a)  PROCEDURE
        FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.  Any Option or SAR\n    granted hereunder
        shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan\n    and at such times
        and under such conditions as determined by the\n    Administrator and set
        forth in the Agreement. An Option may not be exercised\n    for a fraction
        of a Share.\n\n<PAGE>\n        An Option or SAR shall be deemed exercised
        when the Company receives:\n    (i) written or electronic notice of exercise
        (in accordance with the terms\n    of the Option or SAR) from the person entitled
        to exercise the Option or\n    SAR, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with
        respect to which the Option\n    is exercised. Full payment may consist of
        any consideration and method of\n    payment authorized by the Administrator
        and permitted by the Agreement and\n    the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise
        of an Option shall be issued in the\n    name of the Optionee or, if requested
        by the Optionee, in the name of the\n    Optionee and his or her spouse. Until
        the Shares are issued (as evidenced by\n    the appropriate entry on the books
        of the Company or of a duly authorized\n    transfer agent of the Company),
        no right to vote or receive dividends or any\n    other rights as a shareholder
        shall exist with respect to the Optioned\n    Stock, notwithstanding the exercise
        of the Option. The Company shall issue\n    (or cause to be issued) such Shares
        promptly after the Option is exercised.\n    No adjustment will be made for
        a dividend or other right for which the\n    record date is prior to the date
        the Shares are issued, except as provided\n    in Section 15 of the Plan.\n\n
        \       Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares\n
        \   thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under
        the\n    Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.\n
        \   Exercise of a SAR in any manner shall, to the extent the SAR is exercised,\n
        \   result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter shall be\n
        \   available for purposes of the Plan, and the SAR shall cease to be\n    exercisable
        to the extent it has been exercised.\n\n        (b)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS
        STATUS AS CHAIRMAN.  Upon termination of\n    an Optionee's Continuous Status
        as Chairman (other than termination by\n    reason of the Optionee's death),
        the Optionee may, but only within\n    ninety (90) days after the date of
        such termination, exercise his or her\n    Option or SAR to the extent that
        it was exercisable at the date of such\n    termination. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, however, an Option or SAR may\n    not be exercised after the date
        the Option or SAR would otherwise expire by\n    its terms due to the passage
        of time from the date of grant.\n\n        (c)  TERMINATION OF CONTINUOUS
        EMPLOYMENT.  Upon termination of an\n    Optionee's Continuous Status as Employee
        (other than termination by reason\n    of the Optionee's death), the Optionee
        may, but only within ninety (90) days\n    after the date of such termination,
        exercise his or her Option or SAR to the\n    extent that it was exercisable
        at the date of such termination.\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
        an Option or SAR may not be\n    exercised after the date the Option or SAR
        would otherwise expire by its\n    terms due to the passage of time from the
        date of grant.\n\n        (d)  DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  If an Optionee dies (i)
        while an Employee or\n    Chairman, the Option or SAR may be exercised at
        any time within six (6)\n    months (or such other period of time not exceeding
        twelve (12) months as\n    determined by the Administrator) following the
        date of death by the\n    Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the
        right to exercise the\n    Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the
        extent of the right to\n    exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee
        continued living and\n    terminated his or her employment six (6) months
        (or such other period of\n    time not exceeding twelve (12) months as determined
        by the Administrator)\n    after the date of death; or (ii) within ninety
        (90) days after the\n    termination of Continuous Status as an Employee or
        Chairman, the Option or\n    SAR may be exercised, at any time within six
        (6) months (or such other\n    period of time not exceeding twelve (12) months
        as determined by the\n    Administrator) following the date of death by the
        Optionee's estate or by a\n    person who acquired the right to exercise the
        Option or SAR by bequest or\n    inheritance, but only to the extent of the
        right to exercise that had\n    accrued at the date of termination. If the
        Option or SAR is not so exercised\n    within the time specified herein, the
        Option or SAR shall terminate, and the\n    Shares covered by such Option
        or SAR shall revert to the Plan.\n\n        Notwithstanding the foregoing,
        however, an Option or SAR may not be\n    exercised after the date the Option
        or SAR would otherwise expire by its\n    terms due to the passage of time
        from the date of grant.\n\n<PAGE>\n        (e)  BUYOUT PROVISIONS.  The Administrator
        may at any time offer to buy\n    out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option
        or SAR previously granted\n    based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator
        shall establish and\n    communicate to the Optionee at the time that such
        offer is made.\n\n    12.  STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.\n\n        (a)  RIGHTS TO
        PURCHASE.  Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either\n    alone, in addition
        to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan\n    and/or cash
        awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator\n    determines that
        it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall\n    advise the
        Optionee in writing or electronically, of the terms, conditions\n    and restrictions
        related to the offer, including the number of Shares that\n    the Optionee
        shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the\n    time within
        which the Optionee must accept such offer. The offer shall be\n    accepted
        by execution of an Agreement in the form determined by the\n    Administrator.\n\n
        \       (b)  REPURCHASE OPTION.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise,\n
        \   the Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable
        upon\n    the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service
        with the\n    Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The
        purchase price\n    for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Agreement shall
        be the original price\n    paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation
        of any indebtedness of\n    the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option
        shall lapse at a rate\n    determined by the Administrator.\n\n        (c)
        \ OTHER PROVISIONS.  The Agreement shall contain such other terms,\n    provisions
        and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be\n    determined by
        the Administrator in its sole discretion.\n\n        (d)  RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.
        \ Once the Stock Purchase Right is\n    exercised, the purchaser shall have
        the rights equivalent to those of a\n    shareholder, and shall be a shareholder
        when his or her purchase is entered\n    upon the records of the duly authorized
        transfer agent of the Company. No\n    adjustment will be made for a dividend
        or other right for which the record\n    date is prior to the date the Stock
        Purchase Right is exercised, except as\n    provided in Section 15 of the
        Plan.\n\n    13.  TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS, SARS AND STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.
        \ Unless\ndetermined otherwise by the Administrator, an Option, SAR or Stock
        Purchase\nRight may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred,
        or disposed\nof in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent
        or distribution or\npursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined
        by the Code or Title\n1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and
        may be exercised, during\nthe lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.
        If the Administrator makes\nan Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right transferable,
        such Option, SAR or Stock\nPurchase Right shall contain such additional terms
        and conditions as the\nAdministrator deems appropriate.\n\n    14.  STOCK
        WITHHOLDING TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAX OBLIGATIONS.  When an\nOptionee incurs
        tax liability in connection with the exercise of an Option, SAR\nor Stock
        Purchase Right, which tax liability is subject to tax withholding under\napplicable
        tax laws, and the Optionee is obligated to pay the Company an amount\nrequired
        to be withheld under applicable tax laws, the Optionee may satisfy the\nwithholding
        tax obligation (including, at the election of the Optionee, any\nadditional
        amount which the Optionee desires to have withheld in order to\nsatisfy in
        whole or in part the Optionee's full estimated tax in connection with\nthe
        exercise) by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be\nissued
        upon exercise of the Option, or the Shares to be issued upon exercise of\nthe
        SAR or Stock Purchase Right, if any, that number of Shares having a Fair\nMarket
        Value equal to the amount required to be withheld (and any additional\namount
        desired to be withheld, as aforesaid). The Fair Market Value of the\nShares
        to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to\nbe
        withheld is to be determined (the \"Tax Date\").\n\n    All elections by an
        Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall\nbe made in writing
        in a form acceptable to the Administrator and shall be\nsubject to the following
        restrictions:\n\n        (i) the election must be made on or prior to the
        applicable Tax Date;\n    and\n\n<PAGE>\n        (ii) all elections shall
        be subject to the consent or disapproval of the\n    Administrator.\n\n    In
        the event the election to have Shares withheld is made by an Optionee and\nthe
        Tax Date is deferred under Section 83 of the Code because no election is\nfiled
        under Section 83(b) of the Code, the Optionee shall receive the full\nnumber
        of Shares with respect to which the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right\nis
        exercised but such Optionee shall be unconditionally obligated to tender back\nto
        the Company the proper number of Shares on the Tax Date.\n\n    15.  ADJUSTMENTS
        UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, DISSOLUTION, MERGER OR\nASSET SALE.\n\n        (a)
        \ CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION.  Subject to any required action by the\n    shareholders
        of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by\n    each
        outstanding Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of\n    shares
        of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the\n    Plan
        but as to which no Options, SARs or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been\n
        \   granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or\n
        \   expiration of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, as well as the price\n
        \   per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option, SAR
        or\n    Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase
        or\n    decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting
        from a\n    stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination
        or\n    reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease
        in\n    the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt
        of\n    consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of
        any\n    convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have
        been\n    \"effected without receipt of consideration.\" Such adjustment shall
        be made\n    by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final,
        binding\n    and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance
        by the\n    Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible
        into\n    shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by
        reason\n    thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of
        shares of\n    Common Stock subject to an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right.\n\n
        \       (b)  DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION.  In the event of the proposed\n    dissolution
        or liquidation of the Company, all outstanding Options, SARs and\n    Stock
        Purchase Rights will terminate immediately prior to the consummation\n    of
        such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator. The\n
        \   Administrator may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances,\n
        \   declare that any Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate as
        of a\n    date fixed by the Administrator and give each Optionee the right
        to exercise\n    his or her Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all
        or any part of the\n    Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option,
        SAR or Stock\n    Purchase Right would not otherwise be exercisable.\n\n        (c)
        \ MERGER OR ASSET SALE.  Unless otherwise determined by the\n    Administrator,
        in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another\n    corporation,
        or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company,\n    each outstanding
        Option, SAR and Stock Purchase Right shall be assumed or an\n    equivalent
        option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a\n    Parent
        or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the\n    successor
        corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option, SAR or\n    Stock
        Purchase Right, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the right to\n    exercise
        the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the Optioned\n    Stock,
        including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or\n    exercisable.
        If an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right becomes fully vested\n    and exercisable
        in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a\n    merger or sale
        of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Optionee in\n    writing or
        electronically that the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall\n    be
        fully vested and exercisable for a period of thirty (30) days from the\n    date
        of such notice, and the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall\n    terminate
        upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this\n    paragraph,
        the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right shall be considered\n    assumed if,
        following the merger or sale of assets, the option or right\n    confers the
        right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock\n    subject
        to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the\n    merger
        or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other\n\n<PAGE>\n\n
        \   securities or property) received in the merger or sale of assets by\n
        \   holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the\n
        \   transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the\n
        \   type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the\n    outstanding
        Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration\n    received in the
        merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the\n    succesor corporation
        or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the\n    consent of the successor
        corporation, provide for the consideration to be\n    received upon the exercise
        of the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, for\n    each Share of Optioned
        Stock subject to the Option, SAR or Stock Purchase\n    Right, to be solely
        common stock of the successor corporation or its\n    Parent equal in fair
        market value to the per share consideration received\n    by holders of Common
        Stock in the merger or sale of assets.\n\n        (d)  CHANGE IN CONTROL.
        \ In the event of a \"Change in Control\" of the\n    Company, as defined
        in paragraph (e) below, unless otherwise determined by\n    the Administrator
        prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control, the\n    following acceleration
        and valuation provisions shall apply:\n\n           (i) Any Options, SARs
        and Stock Purchase Rights outstanding as of the\n       date such Change in
        Control is determined to have occurred that are not\n       yet exercisable
        and vested on such date shall become fully exercisable\n       and vested;
        and\n\n          (ii) The value of all outstanding Options, SARs and Stock
        Purchase\n       Rights shall, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator
        at or\n       after grant, be cashed-out. The amount at which such Options,
        SARs and\n       Stock Purchase Rights shall be cashed out shall be equal
        to the excess of\n       (x) the Change in Control Price (as defined below)
        over (y) the exercise\n       price of the Common Stock covered by the Option,
        SAR or Stock Purchase\n       Right. The cash-out proceeds shall be paid to
        the Optionee or, in the\n       event of death of an Optionee prior to payment,
        to the estate of the\n       Optionee or to a person who acquired the right
        to exercise the Option,\n       SAR or Stock Purchase Right by bequest or
        inheritance.\n\n        (e)  DEFINITION OF \"CHANGE IN CONTROL\".  For purposes
        of this\n    Section 15, a \"Change in Control\" means the happening of any
        of the\n    following:\n\n           (i) When any \"person\", as such term
        is used in Sections 13(d) and\n       14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than
        the Company, a Subsidiary or a\n       Company employee benefit plan, including
        any trustee of such plan acting\n       as trustee) is or becomes the \"beneficial
        owner\" (as defined in\n       Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly
        or indirectly, of securities\n       of the Company representing fifty percent
        (50%) or more of the combined\n       voting power of the Company's then outstanding
        securities; or\n\n           (ii) The occurrence of a transaction requiring
        shareholder approval,\n       and involving the sale of all or substantially
        all of the assets of the\n       Company or the merger of the Company with
        or into another corporation.\n\n        (f)  CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE.  For
        purposes of this Section 15, \"Change\n    in Control Price\" shall be, as
        determined by the Administrator, (i) the\n    highest Fair Market Value at
        any time within the 60-day period immediately\n    preceding the date of determination
        of the Change in Control Price by the\n    Administrator (the \"60-Day Period\"),
        or (ii) the highest price paid or\n    offered, as determined by the Administrator,
        in any bona fide transaction or\n    bona fide offer related to the Change
        in Control of the Company, at any time\n    within the 60-Day Period.\n\n
        \   16.  DATE OF GRANT.  The date of grant of an Option, SAR or Stock Purchase\nRight
        shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the\ndetermination
        granting such Option, SAR or Stock Purchase Right, or such other\nlater date
        as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination\nshall
        be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of\nsuch
        grant.\n\n<PAGE>\n    17.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.\n\n        (a)
        \ AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The Board may at any time amend, alter,\n    suspend
