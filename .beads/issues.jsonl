Read each notebook file (.ipynb JSON format)\n2. Extract and analyze code cells\n3. Identify issues:\n   - Deprecated API usage\n   - Import errors\n   - Broken examples\n   - Invalid company tickers/CIKs\n   - API changes since notebook creation\n4. Rewrite code cells to:\n   - Use current EdgarTools API\n   - Fix broken imports/examples\n   - Update deprecated methods\n   - Ensure code executes successfully\n5.
